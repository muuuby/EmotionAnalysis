Was craving Korean food and saw this brand new restaurant and had to give it a try! Went here for the soft opening and I will definitely be back! I had bulgogi nachose, dynamite chicken, cold tofu and kalbi. All items that we ordered were amazing! Definitely will be back again!
This place used to be Aranya Thai Bistro, sitting in between Fuddruckers and Mad Hatter Cupcakes at the Grand Canyon Parkway retail hub, and is close to Flamingo Road, 215 and Hualapai Way.\n\nWe came in for an early dinner today. There are huge 4 or 5 big screen TVs that were playing Korean Pop music videos which is very entertaining to watch.\n\nAppetizers include steamed or fried dumplings, corn cheese,\" Tofu soup, etc.\n\nWe tried their house sake and they also serve Soju, imported Korean beer and a limited wine selection including \"Walmae Makgeolli\" Korean rice wine. \n\nAfter you order, the server brings you 5 mini plates of various pickled vegetables such as edamame, kimchi, seaweed etc\n\nWe ordered a medium spicy Chicken wings. Then we had Bulgogi Tacos and Bulgogi Noodle which were pretty delicious and spicy. The noodle dish had a very unique taste and I loved it. \n\nThe service was great.\n\nWe will def. be back and try other more items on the menu. It looked interesting and tasty!\n\nWe also got two mini Hawaiian Frost when we checked in and they were so delicious.
Came here on an empty stomach and left feeling full and satisfied. They give you a good amount of food for whatever plate you order. We ordered the beef fried rice, Korean chicken wings, and bulgogi nachos...everything was good! We will definitely come back again!
Korean food close by! Really good! Big portions! Definitely will come back! Wish they had more things on the menu..
My husband and I took a walk and decided to stop in for a bite. Of course, we were under-dressed in gym clothes lol. But it was actually busy. We were immediately greeted, seated, and asked what we wanted to drink. The restaurant is pretty nice on the inside. Perfect to take a date. There are TVs all over the place, some with sports on and others playing different K-pop music videos. I love it when a restaurant plays authentic music from their country. The menu was small but had great choices. Each dish came with a biwl of rice, soup, and at least 5 different types of kimchi. The chopsticks were silver, the glasses were metal- very posh. The Cucumber kimchi was our favorite. I ordered the Spicy Tacos which were 3 fist-sized tacos on flour tortillas with carne asada in a spicy sauce. It was pretty good! My husband ordered the Spicy Bulgogi. He felt that it was just way too saucy and that the portion was very small. But he didn't dislike it, I think he just expected something else and he is used to getting big portions. \n\nWhen we were there, they kicked off their first night of Karaoke! They have very thick song books, a huge monitor where the words were displayed, and 2 microphones. It was actually a lot of fun!!! I think the owners were there bc even after we paid and stayed to participate in Karaoke, we were offered free desert (shaved ice by Aloha Company), were offered free beer, and even offered us Sake. It was just a really cool environment that actually caused people in the restaurant to interact. We were strangers until Karaoke happened, then it seemed like everyone in the restaurant became friends! \n\nI definitely would go back and try other dishes. Plus, would go back for Karaoke! \n\nWe were served with smiles!
Tried this Korean restaurant for the first time. The dynamite chicken was really good. Very crispy and sweet. Service was excellent, they had side dishes coming out frequently and offered complimentary soup. The dessert was awesome too. We really liked this place and will be back.
Stumbled into this place.  Looking around the area to get some good food and drinks.  And that's what I got.  Great place.
This place is everything! You seriously won't find better chicken wings. I got addicted and ordered five days in row their Korean wings. The stuff is super sweet and nice as well.
Stopped in here today for early dinner with the wife.  Super clean modern interior greeted us.  The staff greeted us immediately and seated us.  The staff was very friendly and patient when we asked questions.  The food came out fairly quickly.  We ordered fried dumplings and kimchi seafood pancake for appetizers.  My kimchi pancake was big enough for dinner by itself.  Both were very good.  We ordered a variety of entrees to really experience Korean food.  We ordered Beef Bibimbap loco moco ( wife, as she does not like anything g with kimchi), stir fried spicy squid, pork belly with veggies.  Entrees came with rice, soup and the assorted Korean pickled veggies, which included kimchi, fish cake, black bean, apple salad, pickled root of some type.  Everything was top notch tasty and fresh.\n\nWe will definitely return.
I have loved all of the different pizzas we have gotten from Toppers!  So much better and FRESHER than the other \"chain\" delivery places!  (And definitely better than Digorno! LOL!)\nThe BBQ chicken pizza is one of our faves!\nThey have some unique and innovative flavors of pizzas too.\nI adore the thin crust style!\nLots of different dipping sauces to choose from too, which is unique.\nDelivery Drivers and counter staff have been very helpful & personable also.\nCan't wait for their next location in Ballantyne to open!\nLocal owner is also a bonus!  #ShopLocal. #SupportLocal
The employees here don't know how to communicate or do a job correctly for that matter. Rude and not helpful when it came to an error that they could have fixed. The \"manager\" was to lazy to ring up my order the way it should be and made me pay double what I should have. Is it possible to give 0 stars?
I have ate so many pizza places including other Toppers and no experience could compare to this location in fort mill. Literally had a 1 hour wait and kept getting told it's almost done only to find out it was never in the over then the pizza came out 20 minutes before cheese sticks. Crazy awful experience. Couldn't explain how bad the experience was.
First time placing an order, pizza and wings were delicious. Great and courteous delivery person.  Early delivery on top of that. Will recommend to family and friends
I have really enjoyed their pizza! Their customer service and their employees ability to talk with courtesy to customers is seriously lacking. I've spoken with their manager, and he has been more than kind, but the kids taking their phone orders need to be trained.
I called in my order to deal with a girl who had an attitude taking my order. To top off the conversation in the middle of me ordering my topping on the pizza she said, \"Can you hold?\" Needless to say I canceled my order and will not be ordering from this location again. This was my second time ordering at this place and was looking forward to continuing to explore their menu. The exceptionally awful customer service that seemed to be bothered to be answering the phone was enough to check out Marcos instead.
Slow delivery, over an hour. Tasted very similar to Domino's.
Toppers knows how to take the fast pizza & take-out model to a higher level.  Great food, great service.  Really love the crust and pizza sauce, wings are excellent and specialty cheese bread is a nice addition.  Much better value than larger national brands.  My family loves it and we're never going back to the others!
Produce is fairly good. Most grocery staples available and always a large variety e.g. bread/hard bread, rice, oil (not sure about milk, butter or cereal besides oatmeal). Lots of frozen fish and some frozen veggies available all at competitive prices. If that doesnt interest you well theres two aisles dedicated to west indian spices and hot sauce! Nuff said!! Picked up two Mr. Goudas Yellow Fire 85 ml bottles for $1 total. Very large bags of rice available here. A small aisle for west african foods like fufu and plaintain fufu mix, palm nut oil, natural peanut paste, palm nut for soup and kotoko kebab spice from Ghana. For those who are in need of hair products, you are in luck. They have the most common products, tools, few wigs and extensions too. I definitely will be back!
4 stars.... Not for service or for ambience but mostly for the largest selection of Jamaican products in the area.  For the most part it's clean, and they are always updating things, and moving things around.  The fish market area can give the store a smell, as expected.  You choose the fish and they will take the scales off for you on the spot if you so desire.  There are bags of chicken feet, legs, thighs, breasts, or turkey neck, etc.  There are buckets of pig tails, pig feet, etc.  In the butchers case there is always a nice selection of goat, pig, oxtail, etc.   The produce area changes from time to time depending on whats in season but generally has a good selection of mostly jamaican produce, with a few exceptions from time to time.    There are a few African, Guyanese, & Trini products but the large majority are catered to the Jamaican population.   It's worth checking out from time to time if you need anything.
Pizza was 42 minutes old when it was sold to me. The cheese was dried and darkened and the pizza was not hot at all. Very disappointing experience when you can't wait to eat after a long day. Normally this location is good, but they let this one slip through the cracks. \n\nI am a former Little Caesars GM, so I understand how the markings on the box work. Each pizza has a 30 minute shelf time from the moment it comes out of the oven until it expires and needs to be thrown out. They are marked 30 minutes ahead of time so the crew knows when to trash it. My box was marked \"4\" which means it expires when the minute hand reaches the \"4\", or in this case at 8:20. My receipt has a transaction time of 8:32 so this pizza was 42 minutes old and expired by 12 minutes when it was sold. \n\nI understand the want to not have a high nightly waste, and it sucks when you make too many pizzas and nobody buys them. But the answer is not to sell expired pizza to customers, all that will do make us not want to come back. Crew and assistant managers should be retrained on expiration procedures. This pizza was bad enough that I don't know if I'd go back.
Pizzas are always made fresh. And when I say fresh, I mean (THIS BOX IS HOT AS HELL FRESH!) \n\nYou get in, and you get out! Nothing better than that! I know this is dumb, but I came with a crazy idea that the next time I go I would time them on how fast they can get the transaction and pizza carry out done. LOL\n\nOH and try the Deep Dish pizza! I know its about 3-4 bucks more, but its worth it if you can afford it. hahaha!
Told me ten minutes has been twenty- still waiting for hot and ready pizzas. Really disappointing! Don't tell me ten minutes and not come through I have students waiting on these with a scheduled lunch time!!!
I will never eat at little Caesars again, while the limited edition pretzel crust pizza was still available my mom and I went to this location and got 2 pretzel crust pizzas and went home, when we went to dish them out I was surprised to find the cheese was moldy and not 'oh it's just a spice' no it was a greenish blue color, took both pizzas straight back, got a refund and went to a dominos.
I usually do not like Little Cesar's. The pizza is usually plain, dry and underwhelming. The crazy bread is usually bland and I never understand the hype...until today. The deep dish pizza and crazy bread where perfection. Seriously delicious. Whatever two people are working today, like right now,  kudos to them. They nailed it! Food is awesome and my coworkers agree.
Lmao guess I didn't need to leave a review I just should have checked Yelp first. Now I'm glad they didn't have any \"hot and ready\" pizzas. Stopped in to grab a pizza real quick and they had a 15min wait one. No cheese or pepperoni. Gotta step your game up guys, Quick pizza is what you're supposed to be all about. The store could use a good cleaning inside and out too. I didn't really want to grab the handle when I came in
Came here just to order a pretty standard meal, one pizza, cheesy bread and a small order of wings. I've been waiting for well over 30 minutes with three screaming children in the car and I've had enough time to create a Yelp account just to complain and I'm still waiting. Absolutely ridiculous and they are handing everyone else there food but me. There's no reason for this wait and I will not be coming back. Most incompetent staff ever.
Got the bacon crust pizza was hot and ready upon pick up. Ordered a regular pepperoni a couple days later and again they delivered as promised.
If you want a pizza that's ready to pick up quickly this is not the place. Last 2 visits all I wanted was a pepperoni pizza and both times I was told a 15-20 minute wait. Hot and ready?????? Obviously not. Staff isn't the nicest either
The customer portion of this location is TINY. Perhaps 5 people can fit in there before it feels very cramped. A small portable swamp cooler was placed by the entrance to keep it from getting too warm in there, which was like a finger in a leaking dam.\n\nThe cashier seemed aloof and did not pay too much attention to what we were asking about in regards to our order. She would ask the cooks where pizzas with a different combination of toppings than ours was, to their confusion. Then turned right around and told us the pizza would be ready shortly.\n\nFortunately, our food came out correctly, which we were nervous about. It tasted as Little Ceasars pizza does. Nothing overly great, but it's an expensive meal or two.
Ok So I love Little Caesar's =) The prices are great especially when I have a full house on the weekends... The taste is really good considering they are only 5 dollars!!! The store could use some remodeling its way to small for a large rush!
Ok so I get it, it's little Caesars which I don't go in thinking that I'm going to get the worlds best pizza or best service. But lawd this place sucks. The cashiers weren't playing any attention to my order or anyone else's. Whatever drama was happening took more importance. There needs to be a better manger than what is there.
\"Hot 'n Ready\" is plastered all over this establishment, yet the pizza you'll receive will be neither hot nor ready.  I called ahead for a standard pizza and crazy bread order during dinner rush.  I was told on the phone I'd have to be there in \"15 to 12 minutes.\"  I said, \"what was that??\" The girl again repeated \"15 to 12.\"  I said, \"did you say 15 to 12?\" She said yes. Hmm. This tells you a lot about the caliber of employee working here.  I get to the store in 15 minutes and there is a line of disgruntled patrons standing around.  There are literally only 2 pizzas in the warmer.  No bread, no wings, no other PIZZA.  No one is at the counter.  The phone is ringing.  Where is everyone??  Finally someone comes out and I said I was there for my call ahead order. She says \"oh we have to wait for the bread.\"  Hmmm, ok.  Tick tock, I'm now 23-25 minutes post ordering and finally the bread is done.  A girl brings up the bread and a pizza that's been sitting in the back the entire time.  I said \"wait, has this been sitting out this whole time?\" She smiled and said \"it has!\"  I said I don't understand why when the warmer is essentially empty.  Another girl who is apparently in charge of solely cutting one pizza every 7 minutes came out from the back and said it hadn't been sitting out for \"more than 10 minutes.\"  Wtf??  I have a 15 minute drive ahead of me, but whatever.  The ineptitude of the teenagers working here is unbelievable.  No one waiting for their food was happy nor satisfied.  What's worse -- the employees are oblivious!  How are you a \"Hot 'n Ready\" pizza joint and don't have pizza ready for the dinner rush???  Not a single person who came in was able to grab and go.  If I wanted to wait 20+ minutes for a pizza, I'd go to a place with better quality ingredients.  This place is a sorry excuse for a convenient pizza place.
I personally LOVE little caesar's. The crazy bread is the answer though. Only a dollar, and pure heaven.
I ain't rich.  I'm barely comfortable, what with student loans and the like.  Little Caesars isn't the best pizza in the world - far from it.  However their $5 pepperoni carry-out special paired with the $2 \"Crazy\" bread (and it's definitely crazy) will feed me for a couple of days and it's more edible than Domino's.  (Side rant:  Domino's is a plague upon humanity.  How are they still in business?)\n\nThis specific location isn't particularly friendly or responsive, but I'm not expecting much from a $5 pizza.
**EDITED. 2 hours after I wrote this I was contacted by the Owner and a manager! They were very accommodating with WONDERFUL SERVICE! I added one more star!----------------------\n-- I am very disappointed in the horrendous customer service I experienced by every employee I encountered during my visit. I called ahead and ordered a cheese pizza with extra cheese. The woman on the phone  kept asking me if I wanted pepperoni on my pizza and I said no thank you. She asked me a couple times but I declined and when I arrived there to pick up my pizza I told her I was picking up an extra cheese cheese pizza for my Grandmother. She said, \"do you mean the pepperoni pizza?\" and I replied, no I did not order pepperoni on my pizza. This employee told me that I did order pepperoni. She then told me that I specifically told her I wanted pepperoni on the pizza. I have never experienced anything like this before- I just told her again that I didn't and I would like a cheese pizza with extra cheese. It was although she was fighting me and told me that I ordered something that I didn't remember ordering. My grandmother doesn't eat pepperoni, and she's 91, so I know that I did not mention anything about pepperoni.  She said something about her phone being unclear or something, walked away from me, and then I guess the manager at the time walked up to me. Again, she said to me, \"I hear you are picking up a pepperoni pizza\" and I told her there must be a mistake and I ordered cheese pizza with extra cheese for my grandmother!\" She also argued with me to tell me that I had ordered pepperoni. I was thinking - how bizarre- because I never spoke to her before and why wouldn't she just want to rectify the situation. At the time I entered the store there were literally between 7-10 people in the little waiting area and a couple people outside. I know they were very busy and I wasn't mad about the mistake-I was just upset the way I was treated. It's like the two employees were telling me that I was wrong. I just told the manager that I would like them to please make me a cheese pizza with extra cheese and I will wait. She said it will be 10 minutes and I said no problem. I was pretty upset because nobody had apologized and instead I felt HUMILIATED in front of a ton of people like I don't know how to order a pizza or that I don't know what I ordered. I asked her what they can do for my inconvenience and she said they would give me free crazy bread. I said thank you. I had to ask for her to do something! It was beyond bizarre. So about 8 or so minutes later one of the many customers in the store told me that he sees my pizza.I went over to him and asked him how he knows that that pizza sitting on a counter in the back was my pizza. He then told me that he heard another employee say \"this is the extra cheese pizza\".He said that it had been sitting there for a minute and that's why he wanted to tell me. I was confused and thought it was very weird, but I hollered into the back area (bc nobody was in front at the counter at the time- also weird because of the amount of people), and a nice new employee brought it to me promptly. I told her that I heard this might be my pizza and she confirmed it. Then I told her that I was given free crazy bread. She asked me for my receipt. I was never given a receipt with my corrected order and I did ask my original person that was working with me that I spoke on the phone- about whether I needed a receipt and she said no. Also the manager said no. So when the woman who brought my pizza asked another employee up front (one who didn't know my story and was new to the situation) she said I need a receipt. I told her I was told by two employees I didn't need one. Then she just walked away and the manager came back. I checked my pizza and it felt colder than usual. I told her that I don't have my receipt because you said I don't need it, but you were going to give me crazy bread for the inconveniences.She grabbed the bread. I told her that I wanted her to know that a gentleman waiting told me about my pizza and how it had been sitting out for a minute. I told her that it was less than 10 minutes and I am ok with this, but I think it's weird that after everything it would be sitting there.Then she proceeded to tell me that it was not true and it was impossible that it was sitting out because she made it. I told her the gentleman saw it and told me and I saw it and had to call someone in the back to bring it to me. She said well that is HIS opinion that it was sitting out there, but that is NOT what happened. I told her why would he make this up, there are a ton of people in here. I told her \"You know what, I wouldn't be upset at all if you guys made a mistake, I had to wait a bit longer, if you just said you were sorry!\"I told her NOBODY during this entire encounter said SORRY! She looked at me weird and I told her I was going to write about this online
I'm just gonna come out and say it. The pizza here sucks. Don't get me wrong, I have had pizza here before, and I wasn't expecting anything amazing, just edible! I tried to order the new pretzel crust pizza and get different toppings than just pepperoni and they said I couldn't. Wtf. I've never heard of a pizza place where you can't add your own toppings. This to me means that the pizza was already premade. Strike 1. I didn't like the pretzel crust pizza at all. Besides the fact that it was cold, there was just no flavor. The pretzel crust leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't really taste pretzely. There was hardly any nacho cheese on the pizza at all. It was just an all around fail. Strike 2. I ordered crazy bread and sauce, which I normally really like, and they were both cold. Strike 3. When we got to the store, we were ignored for about 5 minutes. No one was even paying attention to the customers that were lined up at the front, they were just fooling around in the back. We were about to leave because they didn't even acknowledge us. The sad part is that they have an open kitchen so we can see and hear everything. Strike 4. Shitty services, gross pizza. I won't be back.
Food was average and took a long time to come, service was friendly but there's nothing really special to come back for. The paella was full of seafood and flavorful but the burger just decent, seemed like something that could be found anywhere.\n\nOverall, probably won't be coming back.
I don't know why every Pickle Barrel I go to seems like it's way too big and they have way too many items on the menu. However, I would like to say I always order Asian Nachos and they are always delicious. If I made more money (I'm just graduating college), I would come to these restaurants more often and get something other than an appetizer. They have some really cool drinks too; the White Freezie is so good!
I'm a big fan of this place! \n\nWhat's with all dem haterz?\n\nIt's a chain, so just deal with. There's a reason a single restaurant becomes a chain..it's because they have a good product(s).\n\nI've loved the Pickle Barrel ever since I was a teen, and I still love this place for memories of my teenage years.\n\nThis location (Atrium @ Bay) is my favourite.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is really nice, and they have some great seating arrangements.\n\nI love they're burgers, and the surf and turf is awesome.\n\nMy steak and meat is always cooked perfectly ( I love the medium rare)\n\nThe Bellini's and Daq's are HUGE.\n\nI suggest if you want to get all liquored up, don't order them. If you want something delicious to sip on through your meal, order em.\n\nAnd then there's the desert menu.\n\nJust one thing to say about that:\n\nDIABETUS MAXIMUS.\n\nGo all out and get the sampler. You'll regret it right after you eat it, maybe for the next day or two, but a few days later, you'll wanna do it all over again.
About the only things that I can comment on here are the Pickle Barrel Famous Nachos and the Chocolate Molten Lava Cake.\n\nThe nachos are great! Probably the best that I've had. Plenty of toppings, including tomato sauce which causes the nachos to be fairly soft (maybe even a little soggy) - but that's definitely preferable to the hard/well baked/burnt nachos I've had elsewhere.\n\nThe Lava cake is also delicious.  Maybe not the best that I've had, but very tasty nonetheless.\n\nThey have a huge menu, but haven't tried much else as the nachos and lava cake are usually enough for me to share with my wife.\n\nService is pretty slow, which is why one star has been deducted.
From it's humble beginnings as a suburban deli and rib joint, the Pickle Barrel has grown to become Toronto's version of the Cheesecake Factory (at least until the actual Cheesecake Factory arrives).  \n\nThe chain's own slogan now promises 'something for everyone', a claim backed up by a phonebook-sized menu (complete with advertisements). Time was, if you stuck to the old-school deli, the all-day breakfasts and the Passover menu (for the doubly-unkosher cihcken fingers and greek salad) you could still put together an enjoyable greasy-spoon experience. \n\nThen, they hired Rose Reisman as a consultant, and all Hell broke loose. \n\nToday's Pickle Barrel largely eschews the food and portion sizes of yore. There are wraps. There are panini. There is nutty couscous. I want to know what nutty couscous decided these options were necessary. \n\nDeli staple lox and cream cheese is no longer available on a proper bagel; only thin slices of stale black bread (did I mention that dinner used to come with a massive, fresh pumpernickel loaf? Just sayin').  \n\nBran muffins that tasted as good as they tenderized your innards are nowhere to be found. Proper greasebomb latkes have only recently returned, a quarter of their former size, while the illustriously deep-fried french toast seems to be gone for good (NOTE TO FOODIES: THEY SELL IT AT THE NEW YORKER DELI ON BAY STREET). \n\nRibs are still fine, but smothered in iteratively sweeter sauce for higher prices. Liver with onions and a bonus grilled hot dog is but a memory. \n\nI pause to note that I am reviewing a restaurant that no longer exists. \n\nI wonder if this is how the Cheesecake factory got it's start.
I had such a great lunch at the other Pickle Barrel nearby, that I decided to grab some breakfast here a few days later. Well it was my second choice, because Eggspectation was extremely packed. Anyways we had such a good meal, that I am kind of happy that the other place was too busy. I ordered a delicious mixed berry waffle. It was pretty good and to wash it down, I had some orange juice. The place serves breakfast all day, so don't worry about getting here at any particular time. Go, because while it may be a small chain, Pickle Barrel is greatness!
worst meal worst service rude non attentive waiter for lunch and there was hardly anyone there
So Disappointed.  The service was TERRIBLE.  My husband and I were ignored.  We were sitting next to a clock and it was literally 23 minutes before a server addressed us and took our drink order.  The servers were to busy singing and dancing to the crappy pop music to notice any of the customers.  Our server could not pronounce most of the items on the menu...  Only in Canada do you pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant.  You should never pay more than $2.50 for a taco.  I will have to get my Mexican food fix when I am back in the States.  Pretentious and overpriced.  This place makes a mockery of Mexican culture.
Went here on Monday night, had one of the worst experiences dining out I have ever had, four of us. Went without a reservation, sat at the bar no problem ot took a good 30 mins to even get service. Ordered two draughts a bottle of beer and a coke. Another 15 mins or so and our waitress come back with a single bottle of beer no explanation and walks off. We grabbed her on the way by and asked where the draughts were and the coke and bottle of beer she said \"Oh we're out of draught and have been all night\" then we finally got the rest of our drinks like 10 mins later. We order all of our food comes out separately at different times and the wrong dishes come out a couple of times. There is also the issue of having food allergy and ordering my food without avocado, surprise it still had avocado. This was the worst dining experience I've had in Toronto. This was the 2nd and last time we will go there. They are overpriced surly and lazy. No explanations as to the horrible experience and nothing was done to rectify the situation when we brought it to the attn of the host. Create a nice memory and eat out of a dumpster instead.
This place is awesome! The food is amazing! I love the steak burritos and their guacamole is to die for! The service is fantastic! I seem to get the same waiter, always pleasant and fast! It's very loud so not a place for a romantic dinner. I love going here with a bunch of girlfriends to catch up!
Usualy enjoy this place to an extent. I guess I've never really sat down for a meal there. Today I brought my mother in for lunch. We got 3 tacos each for $15 and a couple of drinks. Thinking the bill would be around $35 or so before tax, I was surprised to see the bill was over $50! Why? Our waiter charged us for the guacamole he brought to our table, $9. We were also charged about $4 for ' homemade sour cream' which we never asked for. Now the waiter did ask my mom, when I was in the washroom \"do you want guacamole with your (complimentary) chips?\" She didn't know, she just said 'yes', assuming it was free....since she should've asked (should've been told!) if there was a charge,I'll give them that,...but the sour cream?? It's not the charge, it's the principal.  I'm not a fan of sneaky servers or the managers that condone them, being a server myself that doesn't rip off her customers, i know this guy was just looking to add more $ to the bill to get a bigger tip. We just took the excess charges out of his tip. When I asked him about the guacamole he was quick to point out the price is on the menu, therefore justifying his actions. He knows what he's doing, and he knows it's sneaky and wrong. So this guy just lost me as a customer.
I wanted to like this place, I really did. I'll give it my two stars because the tacos were tasty, the decor was top notch. I'd heard buzz before it opened....Here's the thing, the staff were completely unorganized, some even nauseating.  A little more interested in hmmmm, being hip? \n\nSat at the oyster bar, didn't even get asked for drink orders for a good ten. Yet, there's five guys behind the bar (with a mean age of 22?) busy hive-fiving their pals sitting at the bar, texting, tweeting, whatever, instead of serving... A tad unprofessional boys. \n\nNext, bartender taking a shot with his pal (with subsequent high-five) steps out to bear-hug his buddy elbows my gf and knocks her purse to the floor. Yes, an accident, but not even an acknowledgment.... Was it the shots, kid? \n\nAsked about their beer on tap and the server says \"umm, I dunno what it's like; some Mexican beer?\"..... Really? \n\nOrdered an appetizer, as in, pre-dinner bite, which of course came 35 minutes after our order, with our meal; ouch. \n\nThis is Mexican people, not beef bourguignon.   \n\nOkay, it's new... I know it's tough working out the bugs in a new restaurant; and yes, its junction.... But management, there's more to hiring people with personality, experience, and professionalism than the number of tat's on ones forearms. \n\nI'm going to have to head a little further south for my tacos still, GE, style.
I can't understand why this place has so many good reviews. If want to hang out in a cool,trend,pretending to be in Mexico and spend lots of your money just go there. If you look for a great food definitely there is not the place. Its  not about the quality of the food but about how much you spend x how long you stay in this Mexico trend place. My seafood was completely overcooked. Im giving one star because the decoration is GREAT.  I assume the other locations are the same.
It may be expensive here, but the food is really good. The enchiladas and the burritos are really tasty. The sauce on it was amazing. What I love the most was the desserts. I really want to go back and have the flan and tres leches cake again. It was so yummy, you wouldn't believe it! The staff is amazing. They are really friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed talking to them. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.
Went here on a Friday for my B'day with some friends.  \nFour of the six of us were running late for the 5.30pm reservation and I was worried they would give our table away, but I called to advise this and they were kind enough to give us another 15 min.\n\nFood was fantastic from start to finish.  Great chips and salsa, I think we tried every Taco on the menu, maybe a few times.  Favorites were the breaded fish, pulled pork, short ribs and oxtail although all were so good.  We also tried the shrimp bucket and be warned its quite spicy.  \n\nMargaritas were amazing, cant remember which one we had but it was recommended by our fabulous waiter - great service the whole night.\n\nOnly reason I didn't give 5 stars is because we were \"kindly\" asked to leave by the lovely door bitch due to overstaying our allotted time limit for the reservation.\nI can understand if we had actually stopped ordering and were just chatting but hey we had just taken our final bites of the last round of tacos and were still planning on ordering dessert and plenty more drinks.  Our waiter bought us a round of tequilas on the house with the bill to say he was sorry which went down well.\n\nWould definitely recommend this place and will be trying their sister restaurant also.\ngreat night out!
Love, Love, Love their food. So good, honestly everything on the menu is sooo yummy. The seating can be a bit difficult at times, especially when its busy but, honestly the food is soo good. I've been here numerous times and i've never left disappointed. This is my go to Mexican spot. I love all the tacos, the guac, the burritos, the enchiladas, love the portions and beans, rice, everything is just so flavourful and what you would except from a Mexican restaurant.
Mediocre service by a staff who are clearly of the opinion that what they do is beneath them. As others have pointed out, a bit of a barn. As to the food, underwhelming. It *may* be acceptable in a city lacking quality mid-range Mexican food but this outfit and its kin would last about three seconds south of the border. You'd be better off eschewing trendy little joints like this and seeking out better offerings from places like Mexitaco or, better yet, hopping a plane to Chicago and treating yourself to a meal at Topolobampo.
My lunch companion and I are both regular customers of the Junction and the Dupont location.\nToday, we stopped in at the Junction for a lunch.  I entered with a coffee cup in hand, having stopped at a neighbouring coffeehouse beforehand.\nWe were greeted and very curtly told that I was not allowed to bring in an outside drink.  This would not have been an issue if the message had been delivered more politely.  I would have respected the policy and would either have tossed the coffee, or stepped back outside to finish my drink leisurely.\nPersonally, I think it's a small concession to let a customer bring in the dregs of a coffee to finish while perusing the menu, particularly if he or she is a regular customer who will willingly spend $50-60 at a time.  I've been at other restaurants that don't even bat an eyelash under the same circumstances, but I respect that a restaurant may have its own set of policies.\nMy companion pointed out that he was a regular customer and expressed surprise that the server was going to turn away a good customer for such a small thing.  The server very rudely said that they served coffee there, to which my companion replied that the Playa family had now lost his patronage forever.\nI used to bring clients regularly to Playa, but will unfortunately.now be entertaining them elsewhere.\nWhatever happened to treating customers with respect?
This past Saturday I had a party of 13 for 9pm.  I was a little concerned when first arriving as there was only 1 server for our table and I was worried it may affect our service time.  But I was hella wrong.  My entire party was thrilled with the food selection and drink selection.  The prices were right on par for a small group of varying income levels.  The atmosphere was fabulous for a party and everyone said they would be going back at a later date.  The food was filling and delicious.\nCan't wait to try it again!
Service, service, service - these guys obviously didn't get the memo. Haven't been back for a while since each of our three times there we experienced terrible care by the serving staff. On one instance we were asked if we wanted a birthday dessert for our friend's birthday, thinking it might come with some birthday flair like singing or clapping, but the plate was dropped off in front of his empty seat while he was using the washroom. Surprise! FAIL. One another instance, after checking back two times and ensuring there would be enough room for the birthday party attendees and that they would have no issue with splitting the cheques by table, hearing from other bad experiences, they somehow had the reservation go missing when she called to say they would be five minutes late. Happy Birthday! FAIL again. My boyfriend and I went back once more, only to have our food forgotten about. Never ever again Cantina.
Went to the Junction location on a Sunday night around 7pm. We were seated promptly, but were not seen by a server for 20 minutes. When our server showed up, she asked if she could get us some drinks. I said 'how about drinks and food?' She said sure! She took our order of drinks, and turned her back. Not cool. 10 minutes later she was back with our drinks and we finally ordered our food. By Canadian standards, it was pretty good, but  it's still a far cry from what they have down south. Margarita's were very well done. Unfortunately, while waiting to order our second drink, our server, a bartender, and the receptionist were dancing in the corridor to Vanilla Ice. Again, not okay. The few interactions we had with our server, she smiled excessively and tried to be our best friends. If I came here to make friends, it might be cool, but this is a business - there was a lack of professionalism from the staff and it soured my experience. Service was baaaaaad.\n\nLike I said -  food was decent, and drinks were very good.\n\nThings that the restaurant can improve upon:\n\n1. Stricter rules / training for the staff\n2. Don't charge 5 bucks for chips and salsa, with choice of either green or red salsa; the ingredients are cheap, and you are gouging the patrons. Any reputable Mexican place has chips and salsa (red and green) on the table, about a minute or so after the guests are seated. And it's complimentary. Charge $3 or $4 for the Guacamole, that's reasonable. But not $8.\n3. When I go to a Mexican joint, I want to hear Mexican music. Some Mariachi, or Vicente Fernandez would be preferable to Ice Ice Baby.\n\nThere are some good qualities in this place, and I see a lot of promise. But there has to be some progress before I can give it a higher rating.
Everything I could want in a Mexican restaurant. One of the rare places you can get grilled fish tacos as opposed to battered. Huge plus for that alone. The ambiance is great. Service was spot on. My whole table loved what they had. Doesn't happen often. Will definitely go back.
This neighbourhood is not my stomping grounds but my sister asked me to come here because she is a travelin' nurse in the west and she was waiting for an IV to arrive and killing two birds with one stone, she said: \"Let's go for lunch for your birthday.\" Which is always nice. She suggested the JUNCTION which is where she has her injection patrol so she has seen things on Dundas West and Keele that may be promising. Places she has always wanted go but hasn't because lunch is always better at home where you can nap right after. That is how early morning shift people roll.\n\nI know the east end of the city like the veins on my upper boobs so whenever I come to places like \"The Junction\" i feel like I am going to Winnipeg to meet my relatives that I have only heard about from Christmas cards from back in the day when mail arrived in paper form into that black iron box. That thing that attached to the bricks beside your front door that you have been dumping your secret cigarette butts into when you howl into the full moon on those dark nights.\n\n\"Meet me at Dundas and High Park and we'll ask Bob for a ferret,\" was her text...turns out she talks into her phone when she drives and you how that Siri has her own agenda.\n\nWe met just before noon and strolled that area of town that time forgot. There is a Gabby's and another pub and a pizza place and the rest is a surreal black and white postcard of a twisted Norman Rockwell painting that has  a noon time tattooed crack whore looking for ten cents in front of an old timey barber shoppe that sells egg creams and actual postage stamps. It's a weird stretch of a few blocks is all I am saying.\n\nSo yeah, Cantina was like an OASIS for this east end bitch who blinks not twice at a $4 donut in Leslieville. Seriously cute decor and it was open at noon as promised, none of this late start shite that happens in Winnipeg because they are in a different time zone.\n\nI ordered a chicken burrito and a Dos XX draught,my sister ordered the 3 fish tacos with NO BOOZE because she was going back to work but Monday was Sangria pitcher day...oh sadness because that would have been awesome.\n\nSo my one little trip to this west end restaurant warrants 5 stars because:\n\n1. It is the cutest restaurant in the hood. Trust. Sorry but this stretch of town is sad...I know you live here and you're all like 'The Junction! It's so awesome!\" But no. It is not. Yet, at least.  Maybe next year or several years after that. I really do  like that Junction microbrewery beer I can buy in the liquor store at Coxwell and Queen but other than that, the neighbourhood sadly barren. So far. Maybe you have some cute places to talk about, I really don't actually want to hurt your feelings, but that stretch of Dundas  West going east of High Park to Keele is despair on white bread toast...wow, I never say this but gentrify or do something already.\n\n2. Great service, lovely server. I do so wish my sister was drinking and we could have had the sangria pitcher!\n\n3. Best. Burrito. Ever.  And I am burrito fiend, this one took the cake. Concisely wrapped like a fetus of chicken, beans, and salsa with a dollop of guacamole on tip like ke the exquisite afterbirth of Salma Hayek. Perfect amount of food. The one thing that always puts me off Mexican is the abundance of shlop hat looks normal but is crazy filling because it is so condensed and then you want to barf after. My burrito looked tiny and ALMOST made me want to barf but didn't. That is a good thing.\n\n4. I did not want to share it with my sister. I wonder if she had food envy but she seemed happy with her fish tacos. But you know how sisters can play tricks on you, maybe she wanted to trade but we were pretty silent as we ate. Not that we fight or anything.\n\nWill I come back? Not without being blindfolded and gagged with your mom's pantyhose and stuffed in the trunk of your dad's Oldsmobile Delta 88, but I will beg for a Cantina location in the East End, PLEASE!
Went there again a couple months back.  This time the food was quite tasty.  Not authentic, but good nonetheless.  Service was prompt and attentive.  Drinks were good as well.  Will come back.
mmm mmm yummy mexican food. \n\nWe started off with a pitcher of sangria that was really tasty but didn't taste very alcoholic. The guac isn't the best I've ever had but it's a close second or third. The portion is good for 2 or 3 people but not nearly enough for a table of 4 or 5. We also shared the shrimp which was perfect because of the spices they used. \n\nFor my main course I got a burrito that was HUGE and I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it, but I couldn't stop eating because it was just.that.good. \n\nFor dessert we shared the churros omgggg they were so good!!! Bite sized with caramel sauce oozing out, just so amazingly perfect I want more now thinking about it. \n\nThe downside to this place was the service, the person clearing tables kept trying to clear our plates too early and even reached over me to get someone else's plate as I was eating.
Their hard taco shells are absolute perfection. My favourite is the short rib taco - you won't be disappointed, you have to order it! \n\nI will definitely be back to dine here again. It's on a small side but well worth any wait you may run into. My waiter was a gorgeous girl with a bald head - she's deserves recognition (not only for the fact that I had an embarrassingly intense crush on her) but because she was attentive without hovering or being too in-your-face, which is hard sometimes in a place that small. \n\nOverall, I loved all of the food (in total our table shared the fish tacos, chicken and rib) but the rib tacos with the hard shell are by far my favourite, and I can't wait to go back on the sole strength of them. \n\nEven thinking about them makes me want to go, right now.
Cocktails were quite original. Tried Paloma and Reposado Cidra. Delightful!! \n\nOrdered the king crab and halibut ceviche for starters. Delish!! \n\nFor mains, we had the mariscos paella burrito, squid tacos, pollo tinga tacos and beef tacos all to share. Incredible!!\n\nTo wrap up the night, we shared a churros poutine. Perfection!! \n\nOur server was very kind. The food was served momentarily after we placed the order which is great coz we were Hun-gry!! \n\nThanks for a pleasant evening, cantina!! Well done!!
I didn't read the reviews before going to this place for lunch . We were at the neighborhood and just went in for lunch. \n\nI liked the atmosphere and the staff were friendly but very distracted , we had to wait and wait and wave our arms around to get their attention and this is a fairly small restaurant . \n\nOrdered the cantina burritos which tasted great BUT ( and that's a big but ) this place missed the mark for very important reasons .  I've never been to a Mexican restaurant before that charged you for chips and salsa . There's usually salsa on the table and what Mexican food is served without sour cream and guacamole or something ? My burrito tasted really good but that was that . Just a sandwich on a plate no sides no nothing . \n\nSo taste was good . Service ? price ? Presentation ? Not so much
First time I came here --- AMAZING. Food was fantastic, service was quick.\n\nA few months after that.. I went again and wow did it go down hill quick.\nI had a 9pm reservation, but arrived 15 minutes early.. the hostess told us we would have to wait. Understandable, we were early, so we had a seat at the bar. Did anyone else notice that the drink menu pretty much doubled in price??? It was an anniversary, so we still ordered more than a few drinks. \n\n9pm rolls around... 915... tables open up and people get seated all around us. I had to chase down the hostess who then said, \"oh yeah, it got busy so you'll have to wait for a free table.\" Um.. HELLO, I have a reservation! \"OH? You do? I guess I forgot, you can sit there\" *points\n\nYeah thanks. We order some more drinks and food. The drinks arrive, and are consumed.... and time goes by. .. and more time goes by.... Our waiter comes back to check on us, \"So how was everything? Can I grab you anything else?\" ... WE HADN'T BEEN SERVED OUR FOOD YET. \n\nThank goodness I had been drinking all that time... for the staffs sake.\n\nI guess this place got too popular too quickly.
The atmosphere was super fun and trendy. I loved the exposed brick and the narrow but long layout. I had beef tacos and they were amazing! I'm not a fan of margaritas but I sucked one back and it was super delicious. The only thing I would say is that the service was slow and not that attentive - but the restaurant was busy and lively so it was understandable and not that big of a issue! I will go back there!
We happened on this place by accident and I am really pleased that we did!!  We will definitely be back!!  Though we didnt have a reservation they quickly found a nice spot for us (part of 3) and service was prompt, checking in appropriately and also did a nice job to share features of the drinks and food.  Overall, this is now our new favourite mexican food place, there might be others out there but this place just has a great feel, fun music and the food is super delicious!!  \np.s.:  the Pollo Tinga Taco was my favourite of the night but I am sure i will be able to add more to my list in future visits!  Give it a try!
Playa Cabana Cantina was a hit! Having been to the one on Dupont, and not being a fan, I was pleasantly surprised at the Cantina, its sister location. Food was very tasty, lively, fun and very unpretentious atmosphere, and excellent service, thanks to our server Julian. I live 3 minutes away from the Playa Cabana on Dupont, but will drive to the Junction to eat at the Cantina. Cant wait to go back!
Delicious food and friendly service. Sometimes it's tough to get a table but thats life.
BUYER BEWARE: I like this place. I like all the PC outlets. The food was awesome as usual. And the service was decent especially considering we came in a half hour before the kitchen closed. Now with that being said my guest and I left slightly unhappy. \n\nWe were drinking margaritas and each time we asked for another the bartender asked if we were okay with the same glass which was good with us. We still had drink left in each and when she poured us our new drinks  we noticed our glasses which were already partially full, were only now half filled. \nWe let it go. \n\nNext round I get one and my guests says she's good. The bartender again adds to my already partially full drink and the drink even after being filled with ice doesn't come anywhere near full and the bartender decided to top off my guests drink which seemed really nice at the time because she said she didn't want any. \n\nBill comes and we are charged for 4 drinks which made sense to us considering the bartender half filled each glass twice (one which wasn't ordered). The bartender then takes the bill back and adds 2 more drinks to it. So now we are charged for 6 drinks. In our eyes we were only served 4 by what we saw her pour and 5  if you take into account what we asked for.\n\nAgain, love PC. I'm just saying ask for a new glass and beware of what the bartender is doing. We left feeling a little scammed. I'll be back to PC again, just probably not this particular location. And I'll make sure to be more careful next time.
I went there for my birthday dinner last night! And everybody was absolutely amazing from food to the staff! Our server was extremely friendly and he made our time at Cantina even more fun! They all came and sang happy birthday to me with a sombrero and even a cowbell! It was great! Their crispy tacos are to die for and they have the best guac!! Amazing place!
I suggest making a reservation if you want to go at a busy time! They have full service bar seating, which is fine, but if you want a real table, call ahead. \n\nStarted off with amazing guacamole and homemade chips. The tacos are small (and cheap!) so we each tried a couple different flavours! They were all really yummy. \n\nAs you'd probably expect, they have a really good selection of tequila, but also have some fun mixed drinks and reasonably priced beer bucket.
My boyfriend and I had lunch here. The menu has items which contain gluten clearly marked, which was handy for me because I have celiac disease. The tortilla chips were fresh and their guacamole and salsa were delicious. We shared the braised short rib tacos, which were amazing. The service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was casual. Seems like a perfect place to share some drinks and appetizers. We'll definitely be going back!!
So the burrito was fantastic!!! and HUGE! I had the chorizo sausage one with a fried egg on it! \nThe guacamole is super fresh and perfect with those hand-made taco chips. Definitely going to be a staple restaurant for me!
Beyond rude service. A surly staff member posted a cheeky response to my complaint on Facebook. The management promised publicly to send me dinner on the house along with a profuse apology. Great PR, but when I called them on it, the offered me two burritos and told me to pick them up. \n\nThey claim to offer take-out, but they never answer the phone and don't return messages. I was never rude to them even once but have been treated with a complete lack of respect. Unacceptable and completely unnecessary.
Wow I felt like I was in Cancun again , finally an authentic place in Toronto. Just talking about it is making me hungry. So because there was a gas leak in the kitchen yesterday the menu was limited but who cares. Service was great , my patrick swayze cocktail was refreshing and my tacos man my tacos. Mouthwatwring deliciousness I got 1 short rib and 1 pollo. I was so hungry I didnt even take a pic of my food ME !!! Shocking I know lol . My best bet to you is to park in the Green P parking lot by the NoFrills then walk back up Dundas to the restaurant unless your a lucky star and find parking on the side.
Made reservations for a Friday night. Our original seating was not the best as we were right by the door and the overflow of people waiting to be seated were leaning right up on our table. We asked to be shifted down to the end of the long table and were told we couldn't by the host, Which we thought was odd because there was no one seated there. We then asked our server, and without hesitation he moved us down which was perfect! \n\nThe food was very good. The guacamole was excellent! I had 2 tacos which were filling. My husband had a burrito which was fantastic! The specialty drinks were really good as well. Our server was great and obviously helpful. The menu has lots of options! \n\nAll in all we were very happy. Just make sure to make reservations, otherwise you'll be standing for a while waiting for a table.
Let me just start out by saying that I'm no taco-fiend nor an expert on Mexican cuisine..but my favorite dishes from Playa Cabana Cantina have got to be the guac and the quesadilla. \n\nSome points:\n1. it is extremely busy\n2. It is pretty loud for a restaurant...i would characterize it as more of a bar atmosphere just waiting to get out of hand\n3. Did i say it is really busy?\n\nWe had a reservation for 9 o'clock and were really lucky to get a table despite the long line-up and the fact that we were ten minutes late. I would say the food is tasty overall--I would come here again and again just to have a good time. I have tried Playa Cabana Hacienda, and I was glad to see the quality of the guac was still the same. \n\nI also tried the Paloma cocktail which was really good (though sweet) and the LA food truck and Pollo Tinga taco. Both were good, mildly spicy but not too overwhelming. I didn't find it as greasy as I thought it was going to be.  I think the desserts are overpriced. We tried the dulce de leche cake. The ice cream was delicious but the cake was a bit dry despite swimming in dulce de leche jus. I don't think they should be charging $10 for that. \n\nThe service was really quick and food came at lightening speed. \nOle.
I had high expectations, but they were quickly dashed:\n\n1) the wine list is tiny - almost non-existent, and all the beers are mass produced; not a single micro brewery, only corn-based, beer-flavoured drinks. \n\n2) I ordered the tacos and the shells were deep-fried. Too much trans fat and no fresh items to balance the plate. The portions are small and no sides are included. \n\nThere seems to be a decent concept here because the decor is cool and the atmosphere great, even on a Monday night, hence two stars. \n\nThe menus is somewhat unimaginative and the place feels more like a corporate franchise than a local, neighbourhood gem.
Just discovered this century randomly this weekend and I don't know if it was just because we were hungry or what but the food was amazing. \n\nFish tacos were perfect, guacamole & nachos was great and the esplanade salad ... absolutely amazing. \n\nThe ambiance is very original, cultured and cozy so it's very nice.
Ive been going to this restaurant for years, i recommended it to so many people because it used to be amazing. it was so good, that my colleagues used to order lunch there every friday.\nSuddenly, the portions started getting smaller, the hot sauces stopped coming with our orders, and lately the food has been less than expected.\n\nToday i decided to give it another shot and ordered some tacos via Ubereats. \nAs soon as it arrived, I opened the takeout box and saw that my guacamole was blackened- as if it had been a day old guac they had left over and just dolloped over my tacos.\nNow for kitchen standards to send that out to a customer is unacceptable. Its old guac, poor quality food being delivered. \n\nI called the restaurant immediately to complain, and the waitress or whoever answered, basically blamed the uber driver for taking to long to deliver the food, and so that was the excuse for blackened guac. No apology, nothing; basically said i needed to contact Ubereats to complain instead of the restaurant. \n\nAs a former playa cabana cantina fan, I wanted an explanation as to why the $16.00 tacos came to me with gross black guacamole, instead I got a snotty chick telling me it was someone else's fault rather than the kitchen itself.\n\nI know they changed management, but it hasn't been for the better, because everything that was good about this place has just deteriorated. \n\nI really hope they step up their game, and treat customers better than they have lately, especially when it concerns the quality of food that we as customers are paying for, and expecting better quality.
The food was good but not worth the price. The service was dull and non-engaging. Aside from the hipsters the atmosphere was great. I wont go back nor recommend. \n\nA tv would be nice as its World Cup
I really enjoy this place !!!!   The Food and atmosphere are awesome. The only downside is they are expensive  but it's still worth the splurge once and awhile
The food is OK, nothing drop dead spectacular (though I remember the fish tacos were tasty). Service was spotty - we got a lot of attention and then none at all. Loud, busy, long wait for tables. I am soured that our pitcher of mojitos was so watered down and full of excess ice, I think they forgot the rum - which is a surefire way to make me pass on the place again. I wish Yelp allowed half stars... this is a 2.5* in my books but I'm rounding down because watered down drinks is a sin.
BBQ is very nice, especially seekh kabaab and paratha are quite authentic, Behari kabaabs are as behari as it could get (coming from someone with lots of behari friends). Chicken Karahi is very good too, the portions are a bit small, food is a lil pricey but definitely worth the money. Weekends can be quite busy, so get there early.
Halal food. \n\nWent here a while back and just remembered to yelp it. My family still visits this place. Must say, the service was one of those memorable moments for me. When we went, they were very friendly. The food is great tasting and a bit on the spicy side but that's not that bad. The only thing I would say is that the portions are a bit small for the price. Otherwise, thumbs up!
Amazing food but very small portions, parhatas are the best. Do try their Behari Kebabs with parhatas.
i think this is the only Pakistani restaurant which serves decent food the only thing is it is a bit expensive
With some of the best BBQ food in the GTA, Cafe de Khan is exactly the Pakistani restaurant that Mississauga has been lacking for quite some time now.\n\nWhile i was born in Canada, my family was born and raised in Pakistan.  We rarely look forward to going out for Pakistani food...i mean why would you go out when you can make better at home right?  WRONG!!!\n\nWhile some of their other menu options like their butter chicken were nothing to rave about, the kebabs here may quite possibly change your life!  In all honesty, pretty much everything we've tried off the grill has been worth bragging about.  I highly recommend the kebabs (ground beef skewers), the bihari boti (BBQ beef cubes - tender to the point that they will melt in your mouth), chicken tikka, and the matka ghost (lamb cooked in a clay pot with fresh herbs...a must try!).\n\nWhat really differentiates this place from all others is their bread options.  While their naan is fresh out of their in-house tandoor (never frozen...made fresh to order and fantastic!), the parathas are superb with anything off the grill.  Parathas are like fried tortillas...thin, soft, buttered to death and sooo tasty that you know your stomach will hurt for the rest of the day.  While i recommend the parathas for things off the grill, i also recommend getting a couple naans if you are in a large group or particularly with any dish that has a gravy or is stew like (ie. not off the grill).  \n\nWith a genuinely nice owner, a clean environment, and great prices for such superb food...Cafe de Khan is the reason you want to pack your bags and make the road trip to heartland!  \n\nplease note: all food prepared here is certified halal.
This place had terrible service. Their food was overpriced and not that good for the most part. I think I did like their kababs and the naans/parathas.
Ordered the chicken and mutton biryanis \n\nBoth lacked the flavour. Seems the Chicken and mutton pieces were just thrown without cooking in the biryani
Best bihari paratha roll in town! Amazing and fast service too. Love the place and the food.
Newly opened.  Clean. And delicious food.  I am just visiting and happen to stop by.  Pleasantly surprised.
The food is good, but the price is high and the portions, as others have noted are very small.  It's unfortunate that they don't give you more.  It is as if they are serving kids size portions for adults.  If you aren't that hungry or don't each much, its great. But if you eat like an average Canadian, you won't be satisfied. With the Pakistani population what it is in Mississauga its unfortunate we don't have better dining options.
Hugely disappointing and overpriced. \n\nReading these reviews, I recommended this place to my friends, and wish I hadn't. First, the menu prices advertised on their website are incorrect - just about everything was a dollar more. \n\nOur server, a relatively nice fella, was easily distracted which resulted in pitiful service. And our order got cocked up.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Tikka Qtr Leg and Kebab combo, asking for parathas and NO rice. I got rice - lots of it, soaking in oil. And one kebab the size of a crayon. My friend ordered the Malai Tikka and Kebab combo, which came with a salad that consisted of cut up cucumbers, onion and lettuce carelessly scattered on the plate, and covered with some sort of sweet-tasting sauce. Odd.\n\n$45+tip later we left and walked over to Silver Spoon to order a takeaway biryani.\n\nThe establishment itself was clean and busy, but the food portions and taste was not worth the money.
Easily my favourite Pakistani restaurant, especially in Mississauga. While BBQ is a mainstay at most restaurants (and theirs is amazing - kebabs and tandoori chicken on the bone being highlights) their karaahis are incredible. My brother in law travels from the States just salivating over the Matka Gosht. Though we grab takeout from time to time because of the rush (portions are still big and everything stays closed because they wrap it tight), I love eating there because the service is always warm and friendly. \n\nI know I've been going since they opened and upon wishing that they'd open a second location (downtown folks!) I realized I'd have to share the brilliance of this place after all.
delicious desi food , lamb karahi was outstanding !!!! Better than many restaturants in karachi !
My favourite Pakistani/Indian restaurant in GTA.  It's worth the drive to Mississauga even if you are in Ajax to come to this place.  They have the best Bihari Kabab, Peshawari Kabab, Karahi dishes and over all dishes I've tried (which is almost all of them) are super delicious and mouth watering.  It's a little small, so, it's always a good idea to call and make sure they are not busy before going - as it's quite popular and there is often a wait, especially on weekends.  That alone tells you that this is a great place :)
Price and quality of sashimi was well worth it.  Fish was very fresh.  If you come here you HAVE to get the sashimi!!!  If I was in the Richmond Hill, Aurora, or Newmarket area I would definitely come here for some sashimi.  Service was good.  Waitress always made sure ur tea cup was full.  Roll was decent nothing special. Roll was big with lots of cucumbers in it.  Fois gras unagi pressed sushi was nothing special (mostly unagi with a little bit of fois gras).  The rice for the sushi & roll kept falling apart.  So the rice doesn't stay together very well.  Once a lift up the sushi half the rice falls off.  Very clean bathrooms.  Overall pretty good experience.  Would return.\n\nSashimi 5/5\nSushi 3.3/5\nRoll 3.8/5\nEnvironment 5/5\nService 5/5
fresh food with good service\uff01I like the rolls and beef udon, reasonable price with 25% off dine in. Will come back for sure!
First time at this place and service was definitely on point. Felt very welcomed and didn't wait long for our food at all. The place is clean and simple, kinda small I wouldn't bring 20 people for a party because you wouldn't fit inside, but definitely a nice place for an intimate lunch or dinner. \n\nI ordered the spicy salmon maki roll which was amazing! The Ramen I didn't go crazy for but a great choice. I don't usually drink miso soup but there miso soup was great and clean washrooms! \n\nThe menus were easy to read and there was a lunch menu which I loved to see, there's options you can choose from. Boxes or a la carte sushi\n\nMy overall experience was an amazing one. Had nothing negative to say about this place and will come back next weekend.
Please listen to the 1 or 2 stars reviews, I didn't, so here it is 1 star. It was a very hot day, and craving for Japanese food, not whole lot options in aurora area. I ordered sashimi dinner and spicy scallops maki roll. \n\nSashimi diner: The fish wasn't good at all, tasteless, mushy, gross. I had couple pieces that's it. \nSpicy scallops: it was okay, covered a lot of spicy mayo. I will eat anything with mayo. \n\nThe scary part is I had volleyball practice hour later, I was worrying I might get sick, imagine myself throw up in the gym or worse (you got the picture) thank god I was okay. Had a good time :) \n\nBesides my own craziness worried about food poisoning, this place was okay. \np.s. is dog allowed in the restaurant? Someone brought a dog ( not a service dog ) with them.
Damn...this is another case of personal greed.  I don't want to write about this place because it's like a block away from my house and I want it all to myself!  They just opened a few weeks ago and it's the real deal.  The ramen is up there with the best I've ever had.  The broth is outstanding and that's half the battle.  The sushi was very good too.  If I'm going to nitpick, the sushi rice was a tad mushy, but the quality is still top notch.  The tuna tataki was good, but missing maybe a citrus note and a bit more of a salty edge to make it great.  Overall, we'll totally be back...good service, decent prices and really, really good food.  Can't wait to try other stuff off the menu...like the tip says, they are in \"soft opening\" phase for dinner...so 25% off right now on dine-in.
The sushi was bland and made with low cost materials. We don't understand why it can be priced at this range. We had a maki set and sushi set and God, we would rather have eaten from mall/grocery store sushi booth. There is better sushi joint in Aurora. We won't go back.
They dont open on time. And the guy was rude. We came in 4 mins past 11 and the man didnt even let us sit down. Just promptly told us they arnt open. If your not open why is the door unlocked? Why does it say open at 11 when no one is ready? How come you didnt let us take a seat and wait?\n\nDisappointing.
There was way too much rice on all the rolls and the pressed sushi. The sushi boats are quite expensive considering how much fish you get. If I want sushi again in Autora, I would rather go down the street to Mi-Ne
Everything in this restaurant is made from scratch in house!! I love it!! When they said home made bread I never would've thought it would be soo good! The coffee is beautifully made along with the beautifully made food! What could be better than that!!
Guarantee the good reviews on here are fake/solicited. The theme is like adults decided to live out a childhood fantasy.. It just doesn't make any sense. Creativity and imagination can be a beautiful thing but in this case it is just plain bizarre. \nBetween the poor ambience and food quality, this place is surely losing money and will be out of business soon.
This is a beautifully decorated coffee shop. I've always wanted to find a homey cafe to study and this is it! The chairs, tables, and decor is comfortable and grand. The waiters and waitresses are kind and approachable people! I also love the coffee here. It's delicious and creamy. This is the perfect place to study with no pressure to have to order anything more than a brew to sustain the long study hours.
I usually do not stay motivated doing work at home and like to go to different cafes or coffee shops to do it. The environment of D' coffee shop was nice and relaxing. Their chairs are comfy and they have ample seating. Their wifi worked great and they were very attentive. \n\nI ordered the vanilla mint mocha and it tasted great. \n\nI would love to see a larger selection of specialty coffees though.
Had the greatest time with you! Brought my Mom in to enjoy music from Joe Darro Quartet. Did not disappoint, and we will be back.  Food and coffee are outta this world! Priced just right for the atmosphere.
Stumbled in here while the wife took the kids to the kids pay area in the same parking lot. Awesome atmosphere, great coffee. Wish I had grabbed a bite to eat to see how the grub is. A great place to just sit and relax.
This place is so cute! Love the food first of all...I've had brunch here twice already in just the last week. The omelette is delicious, and the French toast is out of this world. Probably because they make their own bread in their kitchen! The decor is really cute too and the people here are really nice. I'm so glad this place opened up in my neighborhood. I can't wait to try them for dinner next time!
I love this place. I can spend hours there! The decor reminds me of Alice in Wonderland. Clocks everywhere but don't tell time so it's easy to lose yourself in the moment. Mix and match chairs but compliment each other perfectly...and most important,comfortable. We had the Batista come to our table to answer our questions and explain each coffee drink on their menu...and brought our drinks out himself. We were there for breakfast one day and lunch another. Food has great presentation and excellent flavor. I only wish there were more options to the breakfast menu but I was able to find something I enjoyed from what was on the menu that day. The service was great as well. As a local I can recommend to my family and friends. I hope tourists that visit us in Vegas will come and engoy this gem as well.\n\nP.S \nAlcoholic beverages coming soon!
What a beautiful restaurant !!! The service was excellent...  They were very happy to help me understand the VEGAN options available on the menu... We will come back soon.
Is this place new? Lot's of issues: service menu offerings just to name of few. Great concept, love the coffee lockers, but I think their execution is sorely lacking. If their rent is cheap enough maybe they can hang on and work out the kinks.
Severely disappointing. \n\nFirst off, let me start by saying that we should have turned around upon spotting their 'B' rating from the health inspector. \n\nThe decor can only be described as unnecessary and tryhard. It looks as if a middle aged rich housewife had some sort of crisis and decided to open a business. But we decided to put the decor on the back burner because why judge a restaurant on decor alone? \n\nThe food is a different story. I'm incredibly confused at the number of positive reviews of this place. \n\nI ordered an iced coffee and my partner ordered the house brew. My iced coffee tasted like it was sitting in the back of a dirty fridge for a few days and the house brew just tasted like burned gas station coffee. Also, I'm pretty sure the creamer they used was off. \n\nThe soup came about 35 minutes after we ordered. It was bland and tasted almost like a canned soup. I'm not actually sure what the soup I received was called, because our server wasn't actually the server, but the barista. \n\nAlmost 40 minutes after the soup was served, our meal showed up. I ordered the ham and Swiss sandwich and my partner ordered the pasta primavera. My sandwich was literally a cheap store bought hamburger bun, one slice of Swiss cheese, and some prepackaged lunch meat. Also my sandwich was COLD?! \n\nMy partners meal was just as disappointing. The vegetables for the primavera were absolutely the same frozen, bagged kind that you receive in hospital meals. The pasta was severely undercooked, cold and the sauce had absolutely no seasoning whatsoever. \n\nUltimately, I will never set foot in this place again. It's insulting that this place would charge these prices for a hospital or school quality lunch. Honestly, the name of the place should have warned me. \"D'coffee shop\" really? How stupid.
I must say this is a very lovely and peaceful place to enjoy a variety of wonderful exotic coffees and teas - whatever suits your taste-buds that particular day.  The food is so carefully and well prepared, you will smile with every bite.  It is truly a pleasure to dine there.  The waiters and waitresses make sure your dining experience is Beautiful - \"Cozy\" is my description.  The music is so beautifully arranged. I enjoyed myself to the utmost.
Wonderful new coffee house with a fresh and fancy design. It has great background music that goes well with a homey environment that seems to really promote good conversation. It's just a beautiful place to be. So far, everyone I bring here loves this coffee shop. It's  also going to be the set of their new tv show btw. \nTheir drinks are unique and their food is great too :)\nI would definitely recommend this place to any cafe goer!
Coffee is delicious and the employees are very nice. Nice patio for when the weather is good. Back again today to try more coffee and food!
Breakfast here was amazing! I would come back for the homemade toast alone. The wait staff was very kind and the prices are unexpectedly low. I will definitely return with friends.
Just so people know reading this review I didn't want to give this business one star.  They don't deserve but Yelp gave me no choice to hit only one star.  Anyways, we went to eat here because the sign says it is the \"best kabob\".  The only problem about the sign outside is that their sign is completely wrong and I cannot believe they will make this claim about their food.  I'm sure the coffee is better but me and my wife did not try the other food or drinks.  How can you suggest to recook the beef kabob if they didn't cook throughly?  They did take one of the kabob off the bill but we just paid and left, because this is ridiculous business.  I would read reviews of people who have went there before going here, because you would not want to go here for sure.  We left to a different restaurant that has \"The Best Kabobs\" in Las Vegas.  I'm sure if you been there you would know their name and location.  Otherwise of you don't know the place and never been stay away from here.  Message me for the name of that Best Kabob place to save your money, time and stomach from aching later on.  I would suggest they go another restaurant to take their business or close down the food area.  But this is the choice of the business and that's my opinion.  Good luck and I hope you make an effort to do something or save yourself from bankruptcy.  Don't expect us to come back ever again.
I highly recommend the Maple Caramel Latte! OMG! The teas here are incredible...floral scents that make you think of vacation! The hot falafel are creamy inside! Try the kabobs they are wonderful.
Ordered tru grubhub but never received my order, the DD coffee shop have been having issues with technology for months. Would not try to order again, there are way better restaurants around the block which actually care for Online customers! -2stars -
My first time there was AWSOME! The owners and there dog was so sweet. I love the theme and look and just the vine of the whole cafe as well was the food is AWSOME and very reasonable. My waiter was so great as well, she talked to us and gave us advice and motivated us to never give up and keep pushing an to never listen to what others say. She felt like a really good friend that I haven't seen in Forever by the way she was talking she was great and so friendly!
Only thing I like about this place is the waitress Felicia. 5 stars for Felicia and 0 stars for the restaraunt, lounge, coffee shop , whatever that place is. That place is going down as the multiple owners do not know what to do with it. On top of that, the place is ALWAYS empty. Not worth the drive you are much better off going to Fremont. I witnessed bad reviews from customers myself the time I was there. They did not like the food nor the vibe that they ended up getting all the food for free, \"on the house\". I bet half of these other reviews are fake accounts/ profiles leaving supposed good reviews. But think about out look how many reviews are on this place it looks like from the reviews you read here were made up. Please save the drive to this place you are going to have the most boring time of your life.
I accidentally stumbled upon not just great food, but a great experience. D' Coffee Shop is a restaurant and lounge like none other. And if you take the time to look around at the decor you'll find yourself transported to a place that seems like the perfect setting for a book. Turns out, you wouldn't be too far off your mark.\n\nAs I enjoyed my amazing meal recommend by the waiter I found myself at a bit of a loss. The decorations held much more character than I usually experience. And then for no apparent reason my eye would catch on random, seemingly out of place, objects. Well, in some cases, radically out of place objects. As I ate in wonder I couldn't help but ask my waiter what this and that object was, because there was no way it was done by accident. To my absolute delight I discovered it most certainly was not an accident. Turns out that this very restaurant is going to be the back drop to a new TV series soon to be aired. The title of the series shares that with the name of the restaurant. This turned my meal into an immediate adventure.\n\nNot only that, but you'll find a most accommodating staff. Thus restaurant just opened so take advantage of it while you can. Enjoy a good meal and check out their wide variety of coffee. \n\nYou'll have a good time.
Disclaimer.. This place is new and has a lot of issues to work out...\n\nOkay, heres the deal.. I went to this place on recommendation of another business, as i was looking for a location to hold monthly meetings. I was looking both on behalf of a Fortune 100 company as well as a local 501C3..\nI saw their facebook page, and thought the restaurant looked rather inviting.\n\nOur business associate planned to meet us there and alerted the manager to our meeting. \n\nWe arrive at 9am\n\nEMPTY.  We thought they were closed...\n\nAt first impression, the  restaurant is warm, inviting and very eclectic..\nSo we had high hopes. \n\nThat was the end of the positive experience. The manager had stepped out... And was not there  for our meeting. She showed up later.\n\nThe service.. Very slow.. The wait staff are novices that probably have never served before.. Ever. They couldn't get orders right, as they didn't listen attentively. This was an ongoing issue.\nAfter a considerable amount of time, out comes 3 of 4 orders. We wait...\nAnd wait. Order 4 comes out wrong.. And is sent back.. We wait.\nIt comes out, and is still wrong. All the food is cold.\nI ordered  a cheese bacon and sausage omelette, side of crispy bacon.\nI got an overcooked egg \" pancake \" folder over with undercooked bacon\nAnd sausage, no cheese. The crisp side of bacon was limp and undercooked.\nIts as if this was the cooks first gig ever after graduating automotive school.  AND  they said HE is going to train the new cook.\n\nIf you go for ONLY coffee and a nice atmosphere, you might be OK. Its hard to screw up coffee.. But then again..\nThey an to open at night as a \" Persian \" restaurant. Maybe they will fare better although they have an identity crisis. I will never know as i don't plan to repeat the experience..  You can have a more satisfying experience  with  an egg McMuffin at MacDonalds.. \n\nThe manager finally showed up for the meeting and talked to us as our food turned cold..where is the quality control ?\n\nAs I wrote on the beginning.. They are new.. So if they get their act together as a wait staff, find a good cook, get some semblance of quality control at the pass, it may turn out to be a viable spot.\n\nThere is one review I read that was a 1 Star.. That guy was dead-on right.\nI would question the validity of the other reviews.\nSo D Coffee Shop. \nWE will not be bringing business to you. We shared a lot of ideas, and I did tell you 1 Star in person..please take the feedback, otherwise your restaurant will join the others in that area to shutter quickly.
Like others have said before I have two main complaints about this place. The service is ridiculously slow and the quality of the food isn't up to par. They seem to go back and forth between a bunch of different ideas. Are they a gourmet coffee shop? A fine dining restaurant? A diner? They need to settle on one thing at least until they become good at it since bouncing all over the place and doing a little bit of everything but being mediocre at all of it. Food is not good, coffee is actually decent but service SO slow
This was my first time here and all I can say is DELICIOUS! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed or meal. \n\nWe started with the hot tea! Very good!\n\nNext we had the pita and hummus song with the salad shirazi! They give you plenty of pita to go with their delicious hummus. The salad was very flavorful. My husband normally doesn't eat cucumbers and he dipped in the bowl a few times. \n\nI ordered the chicken barg. The chicken was very tender. I barely needed a knife to cut it. Cooked thoroughly and great flavor. My husband ordered the Barg and it was very tender and juicy. Not over cooked, not under cooked. \n\nThey atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxing. Nice soft music playing in the background and quiet voices murmuring around the room. \n\nWe had a great date night with great food!
This place is horrible. First of all it's way too busy. Who designed this place? It's a mess. The staff were all over the place a lot of unprofessionalism was apparent. The food took for ever, and when I finally got the Seafood Cioppino it was disgusting. The clams were over cooked and the sauce made my stomach ache. Who ever made that recipe needs to go back to the drawing board. The menu is all over the place. I love options but wow, an American Persian coffee shop. No thank you to the food, the staff, of the sorry T.V. show that no one watches. #backtostarbucks
Had friends that went here and had great coffee. I took a friend just now. Our waitress didn't know what type of pastries they had,  didn't seem to want to give us any info on the place as we stated this was our first time and the coffee from the French press was horrible, and the rice pudding had to be sent back because it was unlike any rice pudding we've ever had. I never have a problem paying for a good cup of coffee for ambience and good conversation the interior is wonderful but the service and the menu left a lot to be desired. I was so disappointed.
The mismatched tables and chairs with several coffee cups, teacups, teapots, and clocks as decor make this place sparkle with a subtle Alice in Wonderland in an antiques store vibe- fittingly, it's also quiet and perfect for studying!\n\nI initially popped in for coffee, surprised to see a variety of specialty beverages. My Islander Latte (with rich coconut flavor!) was impressive enough to prompt me to order food. The Texas Scramble was tasty with marinated roma tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms, served with perfectly-crispy potatoes. My guy's Belgian waffle with fresh fruit was flawless.\n\nI returned for lunch, and was thrown off by the Mediterranean menu of kabob plates and appetizers. I ordered a trio of snacks and was pleasantly surprised by the chicken-potato salad (similar to a Russian oliviet), a fresh Shirazi salad, and a savory eggplant-garlic dip, all served with plenty of pita.\n\nAs for service, Felicia was super sweet, and dishes came out with appropriate pacing. Atmosphere is whimsical yet relaxed, and staff had no issue with me lingering over some work for a couple of hours. Good spot to get some work done!
This is an added review to one I posted before.    This is no longer a new Place. It is  not good.  It's Just a  mess.   Coffee place doesn't open early.  I tried it again to be fair    worse than before.   Just don't bother.     Original  ........  I have a home near here for the winter - I was hoping this new place would be better than the two last places that were there.  Don't Bother - tried to fro CES Convention - they don't take reservations W.T.H. NO BAR\nToo Slow\nToo Loud\nSilly concept\nDon't even ask about the live music - ouch\nFood is good if you have all night to wait - not good for business dinners!!!!
Very cool atmosphere. And the food/coffee is amazing. \nWhen you are here you feel like you are part of something special, unique and authentic.\nEspecially if you are looking for something different from the same old played out Starbucks type vibe.\nOh and the belly dancing? ...........AMAZING!!!!INCREDIBLE!!!!! And if you don't understand that it means I loved it !!!!!\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND
It is so sad that after loosing their cook, their floor manager, and their customers they are struggling to keep it open. I am predicting that soon they will close it down for good. They cannot survive with substandard food.
Choices of coffee is wonderful. Service is okay. The ambiance is dark and very different. I highly recommend giving their Falafal a try.
This is a brand new restaurant in the SW part of Las Vegas. It's located on Durango, between Peace Way, and Flamingo Road. Based off of a Made For TV, movie with the same name.\n\nWe had a get together to In my moms honor, on the 5th anniversary of her passing. The experience was perfect! \n\nThe manager took the time on his day off, to meet with us prior to the event. He was able to give us great suggestions to set up the food. He went above and beyond to make everything perfect for us. \n\nThe ambiance was very nice. The decorations make you feel like you're inside a coffee shop in Europe. \n\nThey provide a wide variety of coffee and tea, as well as a very diverse menu.\n\nThe quality and taste of the food was First Class. \n\nThe service was good. The only thing I'd have suggested, is instead of just dropping off pitchers of water, he should have taken drink orders.\n\nThe price is very reasonable, if everyone in our party would have ordered a couple appetizers, main course, drinks, dessert, and a coffee or tea, it could have easily been double from what we were charged. \n\nI highly recommend this restaurant. I will also go back on a weekly basis
What a treat the D'Coffeeshop was to entertain my girlfriend at. We do love our coffee, and the in house Barista's out did themselves.\nWhen given the usual, \"surprise me\" answer to what I might enjoy to drink, Erica my waitress was perfect.\nShe came back with a delicious, cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9   (bubbled top) mug of deliciousness. What a treat it was.\nWe lounged on their grand, over sized, wonderfully stuffed leather chairs and chatted about our day.\nThe sweet linger of the light jazz echoed softly through the restaurant, it made me smile. They have a lovely fire place (digitally) but between the welcome warmth and high definition sound of the crackle of the fire, I couldn't tell the difference.\nIt was nice to be somewhere that made me want to kick up my feet and relax with a book.\nI didn't eat on this visit, but the menu is to die for and I look forward to letting you know what I think.\nCome down yourself, feel the gentle ambience sooth your busy day away...
I love this place!!! They have great pizza and the people are really nice!
I find it hard to believe no one has rated 2 Men and A Pizza yet! We gave it five stars because the pizza was fresh tasting, prepared on time and close to home!\n\nThe taste was one of the best we've had so far in the valley. Very friendly staff from the time I placed the order until I walked out the door with our pizza. \n\nMamma Mia on Indian School is comparable to 2 Men...try them both!
Fabulous pizza and only 6 bucks for a large cheese?!?!?! I love this place.
When you first walk in you can't help but notice how small the place is.  A few tables set up, a large television set to ESPN (I love it!), and a menu that pretty much takes up the entire wall.  Upon first look this place seems to be only a pizza place, but oh no, it is indeed so much more.\n\nTheir menu selection is HUGE!  Appetizers, Wings, Salads, Gourmet Pizzas, the whole shebang!  I wanted to order the Chili Cheese Dog Pizza, but couldn't convince the rest of my party to go along with it, so we went the safe route with a BBQ Chicken Pizza.  \n\nThe food took a normal amount of time to cook.  The aesthetics of the place were subtle and unassuming.  I was really surprised to see a tray full of women's personal items in the restroom.  That seems pretty nice to women who may be unprepared.\n\nThe food was served hot on rinky-dink paper plates, and overall it was really good.  \n\nI docked a star purely for the paper plates and lack of proper eating utensils.  I also docked the star for the box of Capri's that were sticking out of the employees apron as she walked throughout the pizza place after, obviously, coming back from a cigarette break.  Put the cigs away after your break, not in your apron pocket.\n\nIf you're in the area I do recommend checking this place out.  And I strongly recommend the Chili Cheese Dog Pizza.  I may not have gotten it but some guys who came in after us did, and between the way it smelled and the look on their faces while completely indulging themselves I'd say it's a big hit!
I went there with my family, and all of us loved it. It's simple, nice, and the service is very friendly and polite. The ambiance is good and the music in background is very appropriate and beautiful. Remember that their dishes are prepared without any MSG, witch is a big \"well done\"! Maybe that's why the previous review said that is wasn't extra-tasty. We are used to super-tasty-chanease-fake food, lol.\nI recommend it to everyone. The portions are great too. We couldn't finish and took it for home.\nTry the sweet potato chips :)
Excellent tasting food, good variety, very sweet service. I would recommend this place in a flash to all vegetarians & non vege's too. The restaurAnt is clean, cozy, and situated in a good location. The price is pretty affordable, approx 20$/person.
Came here with a vegetarian friend who has major allergies to an array of ingredients. The server was very helpful and patient in trying to accommodate her. I had the vegetable noodle soup, which was huge and filling, full of good veggies (including a chunk of corn cob). I would definitely return.
I don't get what the fuss is about, and I am disappointed in the previous reviewers for steering us here. My partner is vegetarian and I am mostly vegetarian, and we needed some yummy veg food in the sea of smoked meat and poutine that is Montreal. We came here based on these reviews and left scratching our heads.\n\nWe had the asparagus rolls, which are like sushi without rice. They were perfectly *fine* but absolutely nothing special and nothing worth $8.50. We also had the dumplings. Again, totally fine but not worth the $8 or so cost. Nothing at all special. We had the highly recommended wheat chunks in pepper sauce, and it straddled the line between boring, creepy, and gross. I could barely taste the pepper too. And we had a sticky bun, the curry one. That was maybe the one decent thing that was unique and special and worth its price tag. We laid down a lot of dough on these 4 items only to be mostly disappointed. The place is cute, and the owners/servers seem sweet, but they really need to step up their game to be special.
I was slightly worried when we arrived at 6:30 and were the only customers, but they turned out to be completely unfounded.\n\nAs a family of four vegetarians it was a rare treat to be able to order anything on a menu at an asian restaurant -- especially the wonton's and sticky buns that are nearly impossible to find vegetarian.\n\nThe waitress was prompt, conscientious, and helpful, and the food, oh the food.  Everything we ordered was delicious, well balanced, and left us feeling energized and satisfied.\n\nThe curry buns were particularly good (I ordered a second one instead of dessert) and a must have for anyone who likes samosas.\n\nWhen the bill came I was shocked by how low it was, having each ordered appetizers, soup, a main course and tea the bill was still under $20 per person.\n\nThis place is a hidden gem, \n\nBon Appetit!
Sweet little place on Rachel that I went to for a bizniss lunch one day. Alexia and I talked seriously about Augusto Boal and theatre in Montreal while munching on the various tiny cute offerings of the lunch buffet.\n\nSmall but staked with 2 kinds of soup: miso and sweet and sour. I had the miso - well made tasty broth filled with tiny tofu cubes and sprouts. Alexia went straight for the buffet mains and I kept looking enviously at her plate filled with sushi, tempura sweet potato, stir-fried veggies and hot and cold noodle dishes. I went up and asked if the batter used on the tempura had eggs and was assured that everything on the lunch buffet is totally vegan. Neat! \n\nI had slices of pineapple for desert.\n\nThis place might not be the most outstandously scrumptious dining experience, but whatev. It's a really cheep buffet that's got yumps in spade and is super close to St Denis theatre and shopping action. Check it out!
Really disappointed by this place. I'm a vegetarian who loves Chinese food, so I had high hopes. We got the General Tao Tofu and a vermicelli dish, and both were not good. The sauces weren't tasty and the tofu wasn't the best either. It was about $30-35 for a meal that was pretty meh. It's too bad, because it's a good location and the owners seem really nice, but the food just wasn't worth it.
Great vegetarian/vegan restaurant!! A must try, and a shame it's not more crowded! I came with 2 friends and we ordered a massive full of plates...ohwell, it was totally worth it. We ordered fried dumplings, sweet potato fries with home powder, kappa rolls, curry bun, wontons with chili oil, pumpkin hot pot and 2 other dishes my friends ordered as well but I unfortunately do not remember the names.\n\nThe sweet potato fries are to DIE for, they are really sweet which surprised me as to why it was in the appetizer section. Should have been in the dessert area! The kappa rolls tasted really amazing...best kappa rolls ever. My friend and I suspected it wasn't sushi rice but another. My pumpkin hot pot was delicious, the broth was simply amazing. It came with veggie ham, tofu, veggies etc. YUM. \n\nI give this place 5 stars for its amazing food but also amazing service. The waitress was very honest to us, suggesting we order only one serving of rice instead of two. She said it was better to order another one only after we feel like we're still hungry. Why did this surprise me? I feel most waiters would push to make the bill higher by encouraging 2 bowls of rice for 2 people. \n\nReally, this place needs more recognition because it's quite good!!
Discovered this place with my mom, it will definitely be one of our favorites! 100% vegetarian, awesome service, and close to my mother's house, not too expensive as well.
I really enjoyed this restaurant. So happy that I discovered it. So many delicious choices on the menu. Everything we ordered was fantastic. Also great for non-vegetarians who are sure not to miss not having meat. Will definitely return soon. Very friendly service.
Don't let the awkward clinical name scare you - get the crispy wheat chunks in black pepper sauce. They're so good my wife and I had to order a second plate!
Delicious vegetarian Taiwanese food you won't find anywhere else in the city.  We love their hot and soup soup, sweet potato fries, crispy seaweed and many other dishes.  The buffet lunch is generous and varied, but our new favourite time to go is on Saturday afternoons for their interesting assortment of dim sums.  Smoked tofu bun and curried buns as well as deep-fried radish cakes are our favourite there.  They also have delicious and fresh bubble tea with tapioca balls in the summer.
So much deep fried food,what you leave out to ensure \"healthful\" eating,you'll more than make up for in grease. Sort of defeats the purpose of \"health food\",I would think. The hot & sour soup smelled wonderful,so I ordered it, it just tasted sour. The General Tao tofu was neither spicy nor sweet, and the tofu mushy. Service was very polite but slow,as there is only one server on staff. It was a very muggy day as well, and we were sweating buckets as there is NO AC. Overall;no biggie, and I was not impressed.
A nice vegetarian place serving good Asian cuisine, honest and not pretentious. A good place to go.
So disappointing.  Hubby and I drove all the way here from Ottawa for my birthday dinner. I was really excited because after living in Vancouver in close proximity to amazing vegan Vietnamese/Chinese restaurants, I had been looking for a similar experience in the Ottawa/Montreal area for almost two years.  \nWe tried several dishes, each more disappointing than the next.  The dishes were served at slightly warmer than room temperature.  The ones that were supposed to be fried and crispy came out extremely oily and mushy.  Aside from improper cooking technique (likely quickly pan fried or microwaved), there was absolutely no flavour, other than oil.  The main dishes were bland and lacking in flavour.  The portion sizes were okay.  It hurt to pay so much for such a disappointing experience and then drive all the way back to Ottawa.
The waiter we got was drunk for one thing. For the other he treated my group of people terribly. He saw us as mouth breathing Americans and even told me,\"Sorry we don't have any burgers or hot dogs!\" We left shortly afterwards. I would not recommend this place for anyone.
As tourists from Illinois our large group of 10 people wasn't sure we could find a restaurant with Montreal flavor, a reasonable price, good food, and able to accommodate our large group.  Happily we gave Le Paris a try based on good reviews and we were soooo happy we did.  We were  made to feel at home immediately and that warmth lasted through the evening.  The food was delicious, was served to our group all at the same time and was as authentically French as other reviewers have said.  We left feeling as if we had had the most intimate dinner in a French home.  If you are in Montreal, don't miss this gem!
I don't live in Montreal, but had recently visited for a week.  Before I had lived in France for a year, and have had French food all over France, and also here back home in San Francisco.  I have to say Le Paris was my quintessential French culinary experience in Montreal.\n\nLe Paris represents what Montreal is all about for me --- France without the pretentiousness.  I say that for several reasons.  First, the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Unlike your typical rude and arrogant waitstaff in a Parisian restaurant, the staff here is willing to speak in English, and they are patient when it comes explaining things on the menu, and may even engage you in a conversation about the food or what not.  Second, the prices are much more affordable than in France.  A nice three course meal, which includes an entree (which in French means the appetizer), the plat principal (the main course), and dessert, can be had for around $25, which is unthinkable for Paris or San Francisco, for the kind of quality you get here.  \n\nThe food is classic French, leaning more towards southern country cooking, with a focus on hearty and rich ingredients, like red meats and animal organs.  Many of the dishes are stewed or braised in herbs and wine, which is typical of provincial cooking.  Some of these classic dishes include Poule au Pot (chicken braised in broth sauce), Beef Bourguinon (beef stew in red wine sauce), which are all offered on the menu here.  \n\nI ate there twice during my visit.  I had a number of things but I will describe the best dish that I had, which was Magret de Canard (duck breast).  For those of you unfamilar with this dish, it is similar in some way to steak.  The duck breast is either seared in a frying pan, or broiled in the oven, or often both, and then finished with a reduction sauce made from its juices and red wine.  It's not as easy as it sounds, because the duck breast is leaner, and thus tougher than many cuts of steak, so if not prepared correctly, can come out tough, which was often the case in the couple other occassions when I had it (in restaurants in France mind you).  \n\nSo I was met with a bit of trepidation when I saw the meat presented on my plat pre-cut, which means the chef had already sliced the meat into pieces, instead of presenting it as a whole breast with cut marks on the top, which is the customary way in France.  My concern was that the meat had lost a lot of its natural juices by being pre-cut.  But one bite into it had totally put me at ease.  The meat was juicy and every bit as flavorful as it should had been, with that hint of gaminess that is the reason why you would order duck instead of beef.  It was perfectly cooked --- medium rare with red juices running out as you slice the meat.  The breast had a thin layer of fat on top, whch was charred to a slight crisp.  This added some nice fatty flavor to the meat.  It was excellent with a glass of argetine trapiche pinot noir.  Le Paris did an excellent job in preparing this dish I would say.\n\nThe clientele tends to be older, and they look like they've been coming to the place for years.  I find it sad that not more young people would enjoy such solid traditiaonal French fare.  And they never seem too busy for you to be able to grab a table almost right away.  I hope they get good business, because a great place like this deserves to stay in business for a long time.
Restaurant Le Paris is a small bistro that's conveniently located on Rue Catherine ouest.  HOWEVER, it's not well known.\n \nI discovered the bistro after asking my hotel's concierge back in 2007.  My friends and I went after skiing in Tremblant.  We enjoyed really good kidneys and the chef was kind enough to let us try some cow brains.  I've also had the cow brains at Per Se in NYC.  I'm done with cow brains.  I'm not a fan.  It's just too much.  I'm getting sick of foie gras these days too.\n \nJe suis desole for disgressing... Le Paris is a small bistro worth visiting!
We were at the Le Paris on Saturday night for the exclusive beef bourguignon. All the food that we ate were really good. For appetizer we had the egg mayonnaise  and the rabbit pattie. Both were really good. Then we had the beef bourguignon for the main course and then we ended the night with the Ile flottante. We also tried the pudding du Paris which hit the spot and really made the evening memorable.  All in all it was very juicy and fabulous which I would recommend any day. It is a little before the main hustle and bustle of St Catherine street so no rush.
My wife and I went to this restaurant for Valentine's day on a double \"date\" with friends. We chose the place because the reviews were good and it was BYOW.\n\nThe first bad sign was when we entered the restaurant at 6:30 p.m. and the place was completely empty. During the night more customers did eventually arrive, but it was never more than half full. For Valentine's Day evening, that is indeed a red flag, particularly for a French bistro, which you'd think would be packed on Valentine's Day.\n\nThe menu included a fixed price option as well as a la carte. As someone who detests fixed price menus, I was pleased to have the a la carte option available.\n\nThe bread came to the table first. It seemed like the Wunderbread version of a baguette. It came with little butter packages you get in a food court or on an airplane.\n\nAs an appetizer I ordered the ravioli dish, which consisted of a bowl filled with little miniature green bowties that could not possibly have been homemade and I'm guessing must have come frozen in a bag. They were all piled in a heap. The sauce and the ravioli were bland and lacked seasoning. It was not terrible, but not good either. \n\nFor my main course I ordered the bavette steak, cooked blue. The steak was more medium rare than blue, not that it mattered since it was smothered in goopy sauce that made it pretty well impossible to taste the steak. You could barely see the meat there was so much sauce. again the steak was bland and needed salt (you sense a theme here). The fries that came with the steak were adequate, but... surprise surprise, totally lacking salt. \n\nIt does appear the chef does not believe in seasoning the food. Either that or the boxed / frozen food he is reheating isn't seasoned well out of the package.\n\nFor dessert, I did want to order the Tarte Tatin, which was on the a la carte menu, but before I could do so they brought me the chocolate mousse cake, which I guess was the mandatory dessert on the fixed price menu (never mind that I had not ordered the fixed price meal) but they didn't charge me for it, so I didn't really complain. \n\nTo be fair, my wife and my friend and his girlfriend indicated they enjoyed it. To me it was like one of the desserts you get from Via Rail in their first class cabin - basically a notch or two above airplane food.\n\nBottom line: This is the kind of restaurant that would have done just fine in the 1980's as a \"fancy\" restaurant for the suburbs. Certainly not the worst french food you will find, but you can do alot better even for the relatively modest price. The chef needs to buy some salt and learn to use it.
This restaurant is always empty and now I understand why.... It's byow and the food is really good from the tartare, to the bavette and l'agneau. But for the service that's a different story, you really feel in France. My friend wasn't hungry so she wanted to take her tartare to go but it was not possible compared to many other places. When asked to see the chef we were denied several times, saying that the owner/chef doesn't come out of his kitchen. When owning a restaurant another task is to meet your costumers and be open to critic. He literally told us to go eat somewhere else after we gave him a positive critic. We were all on shock about the way he treated us and we promised never to go back there..... Now I understand why it's always empty, it's not the food, it's the service and the owner the problem!!!!
This was the first place that I ever had duck confit.  And it was delicious! Different but delicious!\n\nI also had the fish soup which was very good and hit the spot on the very chilly Montreal day that I went.
We luck out every time we visit, they seem to have the table by the front window.\nWe really appreciate the way we are served, it's always the same waiter who has a great sense of humor.\nAll the dishes we've had have been great.\nDecor hasn't changed in a lonnnng time but hey it's got it's own unique appeal.
Just returned from a trip to Montreal and this restaurant was the place we went for the quintessential French meal. First let me say that the food was great!!\n\nWith that said, the dining experience was one of discomfort and frustration. We arrived when the dining room was almost empty and we seemed off to a pretty good start. Though we did note that the room was a little stuffy. By the time we got our mains (which took quite a while, but nothing I'd complain about), the room was packed and felt like an oven. Our wine and water glasses were almost empty when the waiter dropped off our food, but we never saw him again. The restaurant was WAY understaffed...just two waiters to do everything including bussing and seating. \n\nFinally after waiting a ridiculously long time (and noticing that the waiter was quite solicitous to one table of four older women) and being drenched in sweat with no water, we gave up on having dessert (which was included in the price of dinner), got up and met our waiter at the cash register. When we asked him for the check, he muttered something in French (though he had spoken to us in English before) and walked away. We finally estimated the bill, rounded up for taxes and left cash on the table before walking out.
Really great food. Amazing service. Recommend the Grav Lax, Endive salad with bleu cheese and walnuts. BYOB.
My friend recommended this restaurant since she thought it was good...I am a little surprised at that. My boyfriend and I ordered escargot, steak and chicken. Everytime I tried to pick up an escargot, I ended up getting mushroom...it was also in some sort of beef brisket sauce...so the taste of the escargot was beef-y. My steak, I ordered medium...it looked a bit more cooked than I wanted..and for some reason, it tasted of beef sauce again..my boyfriends chicken dish was decent though...but we were looking forward to the other two dishes. \n\nThe decor is classy, no lineup either. And this place allows you to bring your own wine. However, the food hasn't really made an impact on me.
Probably one of the better dining experiences I've had in my life. \nI'm not an expert on french cuisine nor have I dined extensively in montreal or anything like that but if you're in town, check this place out, trust me!\n\nThis is basically a real casual bistro in Montreal, filled with older French Canadians, a lot of retired people, or a generally 40yr + crowed. It feels like the decor hasn't changed for the past 30 years and it really sets a nice mood. \n\nI've come here once for the duck confit and once for a roasted fish. both times, it was like eating a really experienced french grandmaother's cooking in the french countryside: just simply but expertly prepared. Normally, a fish would be served with a side of roasted vegetables and potatoes, and some pan drippings and it really is fantastic. \n\nThe best thing about this entire restaurant is the brandade de morou. This tasted amazing and is one of the most memorable things I've ever eaten. Its basically like mashed potatoes that tastes like the sea, and ive never had this dish better than the one they have here. Other apetizers included some squid cooked in its own ink and some oysters, all of which were really good. \n\nThe bread is fantastic. The butter comes room temperate and softened. I'm not a wine expert but the waiters were friendly and happy to help. \n\nOverall, this is truly a great place. Reservations are recommended. This is an ideal place to compensate if your not lucky enough to have a french grandmother.
I found this place because it was tied to one of the airline dining programs.  One has to find street parking, pay for enough time in that spot, head in to the restaurant, and \"do lunch\" expediently.\n\nIt is a typical French bistro with a good combination of food and service.  It was fairly full and it looked like most of the people were locals, hence it's a place that has withstood the test of time in providing authentic and tasty French cuisine.  The place is a little dated, as can be expected for a restaurant situated in a storefront along Sainte-Catherine, one of Montreal's main drags in Centre-Ville.  Lastly, it certainly isn't cheap, but it's not ridiculously expensive either.  \n\nHaving lunch here was enjoyable and Le Paris is sort of an entry-level way to familiarize oneself with French cuisine without getting clobbered over the head with pretense.
Hier kann man super Essen. Wirklich sehr gute K\u00fcche. Und das Ambiente ist angenehm warm und gem\u00fctlich. Sehr empfehlenswert direkt oder auf dem Weg durch das Siebenm\u00fchlental. Die Bepreisung ist angemessen.
\"Man kann's esse'\" w\u00fcrde der Schwabe wohl sagen und damit ein gro?es Lob aussprechen. Tatsache ist, dass wenn ich keine Lust habe mich selber in die K\u00fcche zu stellen, die Seebruckenm\u00fchle immer mit in der ersten Wahl ist.\n\n\n Meine pers?nichen Empehlungen und das nun schon seit mehrerer Jahren: Der Rostbraten und das Geschnetzelte. Aber auch die Flammkuchen sind sehr lecker und ... und ... und ...\n\n\n Sommer: Im Garten befindet sich ein \"alternativer Biergarten\" der durchaus seinen Charme hat. Leider auch reichlich Schnaken. Bei Einbruch der Dunkelheit empfiehlt sich ein Umzug auf die h?her gelegene Terasse, die leider nicht viel Platz, daf\u00fcr aber Heizstrahler bietet, oder gleich nach innen.\n\n\n Der Garten bietet tags\u00fcber eine bedingt geeignete (weil un\u00fcbersichtliche) Spielwiese f\u00fcr Kinder. Solche, die gewohnt sind, im Freien und der in der Natur zu spielen, werden ihren Spass haben.\n\n\n Hunde scheinen kein Problem zu sein, was bei einem \"Ausflugslokal\" nat\u00fcrlich auch nciht verwundert.\n\n\n Winter: Speziell an Wochenenden mit sch?nem Wetter, das sehr viele Wanderer und Spazierg?nger ins Siebenm\u00fchlental lockt, kann es am sp?ten Nachmittag und fr\u00fchem Abend schon mal rappelvoll sein. Also nicht zu sp?t kommen - oder eben sp?ter.\n\n\n Parkpl?tze sind ausreichend und kostenlos vorhanden, direkt an einer Kreuzung, so dass man das die M\u00fchle eigentlich nicht verfehlen kann.
Beliebtes Ausflugsrestaurant mit gro?em Parkplatz. Der Bio- und Altbau-Flair der Esels- oder M?ulesm\u00fchle fehlt etwas, daf\u00fcr liegt es wirklich sch?n im Gr\u00fcnen. Genial f\u00fcr Kinder, die d\u00fcrfen rumspringen, ohne dass sie der Stra?e allzu schnell zu nahe kommen.\n\n\n Von au?en sieht das Restaurant nicht so besonders einladend aus, ein Anstrich t?t mal gut und den Garten zu pflegen w?re sicherlich auch mal eine gute Idee. Innen ist es aber sehr sauber und gepflegt und man bekommt bei gutem Service gutes Essen zum fairen Preis.\n\n\n Gegen\u00fcber befindet sich \u00fcbrigens die Galerie Wei?e Scheune von Hans Hahn-Seebruck, die des Ansehens durchaus wert ist.
Sehr leckeres essen und nettes personal! die terasse ist auch wundersch?n nur der garten gef?llt mir pers?nlich nicht da der boden mit geh?xeltem holz belegt ist und daher sehr dreckig! ansonsten top! ;)
Bei Jens ist jeder Gast herzlich willkommen . Und das Essen !! Ja das Essen ist auch net schlecht. \nAch was sag ich das Essen is Geil . Hab noch nichts bei ihm gegessen was nicht wirklich gut war . Geheimtip !!!!!!\nJens mach weiter so !!!!
Man kann einfach alles in ein Wort packen TOP !!! Lage : sch?n in einem Wald versteckt.Biergarten bei leicht ged?mpften licht war am Abend sehr romantisch ;-)\nEssen: sehr sehr lecker, wir waren gleich 2 mal hintereinander hier und jedes mal hat einfach alles geschmeckt.besten Flammkuchen den ich je gegessen habe!\nTrinken: gute Cocktails und zu sp?teren Stunde wurden auch die Rarit?ten an Schn?psen heraus geholt.\nService:einfach nur TOP,aufmerksam,freundlich Wenn ich im Stuttgarter Raum bin,ist es auf alle F?lle der n?chste anlaufpunkt! :-) Danke Jens, Gr\u00fc?e aus M\u00fcnchen ;-)
Wundersch?ner Biergarten im idyllischen Siebenm\u00fchlental. Das Restaurant zeichnet neben dem erstklassigen Service auch das Essen, was wirklich 5 Sterne verdient hat aus. Ich komme gerne wieder!
Sch?nes Restaurant zwischen den M\u00fchlen. Sch?nes Ausflugsziel, man kann von einer zur anderen M\u00fchle wandern und dann zur St?rkung in der Seebruckenm\u00fchle einkehren. Es ist eine gute regionale K\u00fcche. Man kann auch nur einen Snack essen. Die Portionen sind \u00fcppig. Die Preise fair. Empfehlenswert
The people who work here are fantastic, wonderful attitudes, genuinely care about your day and shopping experience. They also have an awesome olive selection. I got some awesome frozen veggie Phyllos and love their frozen section!
Wow. Awesome food.counter service only wed-Fri. Super friendly staff. Great grocery selection.
Between my first and second visits, this store was expanded and brightened up and it was even more fun to shop the second time.  Great deals on their label of extra-virgin olive oil, roasted peppers,dried tomatoes plus an amazing selection of olives and cheeses.  They sell the best pita bread I have even eaten- Kontos hand-stretched gyro bread.  I'm almost out of the stock I bought this past spring, and will be returning for a mega-purchase again soon.  :)  I just wish that this store were closer!
While working on the job, one can get hungry. Man hungry and the thing about man hungry is this...greek yogurts and hot pockets can't light that flame if you get me. You'll need something more heavy duty, something that gets in deep, really gets the engines revving. For that you will need Salonika. Oh what's that you say? You are working all day on making sure some steel pipeline is put into the ground, well then friend...I have the place for you. We are talking, 12 cylinders of man meat sledgehammered into what they call a gyro. Spices so sensational, you will have Bob Vila jealous at your home taste bud improvements. The best part about this man meal is that it's man cheap. This will allow you to spend your real money on lifting your truck, roofing your house or just plain old football, man style. \n\nI give this place a manly 4 out of 5.  Don't forget to bring this man meal home or eat in your car because this place doesn't have seating but that's okay...because real men don't sit...they stand tall.
The absolute nicest, most helpful people work here at this place! Great variety of olives, sweets and savories! This will certainly become a regular stop when in the Strip.
This is an amazing place. It fundamentally a major distributor of Greek, Turkish, Spanish, and Bulgarian foods, with an emphasis on Greek. Chris, the owner, is a super-friendly guy, who wanted to share in a retail setting, ergo the pastries and gyros and more. \nThe prices and quality are unbeatable. It's worth a visit for lunch on Wednesday thru Friday.
We ordered pizza a few weeks after they opened.  Really expensive for what you get, which reminded us of Pizza Hut, and that isn't a good thing.  Haven't gone back, we live in Brooklyn so we travel to Oregon which has a few better pizza options that are less expensive and more authentic.
Excellent pizza and pasta, plus great Friday Fish Fry..all in little Brooklyn. Try the White Pizza, so good I swear they have the best alfredo sauce I've ever had. The spinach and artichoke dip is to die for. Portions are average but you will never leave hungry at Angelo's. Service is good, keep in mind this is not fast food so be patient and enjoy a nice dinner.
So maybe i'll catch a lot of flack because of my low star review for such a popular eatery, but I was not at all impressed with the food hype surrounding this place.\n\nat first i was super excited to see the veggie dog option and the multitude of toppings you can get on your hot dog. it sounded like a savory heaven! and i do mean everything! any kind of vegetable and/or cheese and/or traditional topping and even some not so traditional toppings. they serve salads and alcohol as well. \n\nservice was super friendly and quick, so no complaints there. \n\nbut it was just a veggie hot dog. like the kind i can buy in a pack at sprouts. the flavor came from the toppings so essentially i was eating a salad on top of a veggie dog. and although i'm not a hot dog fan, i especially don't care for hot dog buns. short leash replaced the bun with a giant pita bread. it's so much bread! you get full from the huge pita, not the filling itself. \n\ni was mostly disappointed because we tried some of their offerings at the Yelp Downtown event and were very impressed with what they had (fried green tomato!). maybe they have that at their brick and mortar store or the food truck but not at the pop up location. and 6.50 for a veggie dog just seems a bit too much.
After spending about 10 minutes trying to find the place, we successfully found it inside of a little walkway next to Forge. I had the organic chicken Moki with no tomatoes, it was delicious!  They also use naan bread instead of hotdog buns, which makes it a little interesting to eat, but the softness of the naan goes really well with the dog. They also have veggie dogs too! \n\nThe service was excellent and food was delivered with speed and garnish with a sweet pickle on top. The classic Mexican coke makes an great refreshing addition to a hot Arizona day.
These dogs are great. Now $6.50 is indeed way too much to pay for a regular dog, even for the best, one from Flo's on Route One in Cape Neddick, Maine. \nBut, you really can't call the Short Leash hot dogs \"regular.\"\nFrom the \"dog\" itself to the bread (a Nan-style, good sized pita bread) to the delicious and unusual toppings, this is a special meal as many Yelpers have reported.\nThe help has experience with people wandering into this place, just one of many stalls and shops in this Union mini-mall area. Many people are attracted to the wall of cool photos of dogs! The gals behind the counter were quick to nicely explain the menu--and just as quick I was chowing down on an Oliver, with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and 1000 island dressing.\nI liked it. \nBut, oh how I wish it was July and I was back at Flo's--even if Gail was cranky because someone was holding the screen door open.
\"For Naan Believers Only\" Short Leash Dogs has made me a naan believer!!\n\nYou pick your 'wiener' (all their hotdogs are natural/ gluten & nitrate free):  regular, all beef, bratwurst, chicken, spicy beer hot & vegetarian. \n\nWillie was very friendly & informative then gave great suggestions for my choice of Spicy Beer Hot 'wiener'.  He made me feel at ease to be adventurous!  \n\nSo I decided on the award winning 'BEAR' (peanut butter, smoked Gouda, bacon, BBQ sauce + cracker jacks) w/ Spicy Beer Hot 'wiener' on naan bread of course.  \n\nOh my!  It was delish!  And soooo filling!  Nice blend of ingredients where I tasted each flavor but it melded well without competing. Thank you Richard for making it tasty & perfectly cooked.  Great staff!!!\n\nAlso, tried the watermelon lemonade by Hubert's-nice. They have a nice assortment of different varieties of drinks to choose from. \n\nThere are a couple of tables; but if full, than I chose to sit at the fountain in the courtyard near Santa in his regal white coat & enjoyed our beautiful weather.\n\nPS: in middle courtyard near Saks & Williams Sonoma.
The sunny hotdog is a very delicious and unique sandwich that is like no other hotdog I've ever tried.\n\nThe naan bread with arugula and goat cheese coupled with prosciutto and a chicken dog is a very good combination.
Upon walking up to the dog stand I was greeted by super fun and friendly employees.  The hot dog was made quick and really special.  I sat outside in the courtyard and really enjoyed my experience.  It is a little expensive for a hot dog but my experience was a good one.
I've been to this location twice in the last month. Both times out of regular and beef dogs. Staffer today says she had no idea why as she rarely works here. She seems more interested in checking her phone than working. And if dead fish/zero energy were a description it would fit her personality. Losing interest in this place FAST.
Great hotdogs served creatively, this is a great place for a quick lunch, not too expensive, when hitting The Biltmore. Pleasant staff and the nearby shops make this a really good place they make their own donuts, which look delicious. While they don't offer coffee, there is a good cup available at the end of the passageway.
LOOOVE short leash!  Great service, super friendly staff and delicious dogs!!
I love Short Leash and was glad to hear they opened up a permanent shop inside The Union. The only downside is no fried pickles! For whatever reason, this location does not have fried pickles. To make up for no fried pickles, they do have salads and donuts. Additionally, all the hotdogs you know and love are on the menu and you can build your own. I love building my own - hot beer brat, bacon, Gouda, caramelized onions, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and spicy mustard. Yum! This is my go-to favorite and my husband loves it too.\n\nDepending on where you enter The Union, the shop could be easy to miss because the signage is rather small. The inside of the shop is on the smaller side as well, but that doesn't stop the big flavors. Inside, there is seating along a bar top, where you can watch your hotdog being made or there is a single table outside the eatery. The walls are covered in photos of dogs and the special hotdog creation inspired by the dog. The place is cute and modern with a white countertop and concrete walls.\n\nOverall, it's a great place to grab a delicious and unique hot dog. If I can't catch the food truck or make it downtown, this is a great spot to help curb my cravings!
I went in last night about 845 , wasn't greeted . This girl was sweeping and she said they were closed . It was 846 at this point . The door and google times stated they closed at 9 . What's going on here !? Unhappy employees ? Means unhappy service !
Great food, tons of options, cute location. We have a place like this where I'm from in ny called dog town and this place it just as good!\n\nThe staff was super friendly and its was a nice sunny day to enjoy a warm treat! If they don't ask to validate your parking just go next door to the crepe place and tell them you went there and they will validate it for you :)
I haven't been too the food truck or downtown location.  I have been here twice and I do not know what the big deal is.....I will have to try the dwntn location.  Not impressed w this at all.
Short Leash - what's not to love? I've always been happy with the combos here, and we love the use of the flatbread instead of a bun. I do kind of feel like it is a little hit or miss... or perhaps the quality has changed a little? Not sure, but it's a good tasty little bite if you are in the area and can't make it downtown to their other location!
If, when, how, the, what the! \n\nWho the heck. (Dramatic pause) \n\nCame up with this flavor driven tastebud amusement park for My belly!!!! \n\nAny way you try it. Any thing you place on it.  Your not going to regret it. Well if you eat too many in one sitting you might .,, uh yea just trust me on that. \n\nGreat service. Friendly staff. Always smiling and working hard. They love to help you with fun pairings and recommendations! \n\nThey have all kinds of dogs. \n\n(In slow mo) \nthey have Chicken dogs, Beef dogs, Pork dogs, Veggie dogs, Shriners dogs, boiled shrimp wait not that last one..    \nThey use Naan bread instead of buns (freakn amazing). Picasso had a brush they got NAAN!!! \n\nI've tried them all. Loved them all and lived to share my love with the world through means of verbal and social communication. \n\nHow dare you not go here... You should be ashamed... Bad doggie! \n\nAnd I'm out!!!
I was super hungry and decided to come here because I love the one downtown. The service was prompt and my hotdog was what I expected, if a little worse than the original. I was so disappointed when I got the chips and they weren't made on site.\n\nI was there alone, sitting at the bar and after I placed my order the two employees played on their phones the entire time! At least attempt some conversation. This one also did not have alcohol.
Really disappointed, the hours are listed until 8pm on both Yelp and their website. We showed up at 645 and they were closed. Absolutely ridiculous.  Normally I love short leash, best dogs in town, but this was a big let down.
This was a cool little spot we just happened to walk by and decided to get a bite. The food was awesome and the staff were super friendly and informative. Well definitely stop by again.
If you're looking for a quick, delicious and affordable bite, check this place out. They have beef, chicken, and vegetarian hotdogs which I appreciate. I had the organic chicken hotdog, \"aiko\" style meaning the hotdog is dressed with mango chutney and spicy mayo. They use naan bread instead of a hotdog bun which surprisingly made a tasty vehicle for all the flavors. The staff were also very friendly and welcoming. \n\nWill come back to try the other varieties.
I just don't feel 5 stars are enough.....here's why!\n\nThe staff took time to explain the amazing combinations and didn't hesitate to explore some recommendations.. BONUS\n\nToday I tried the award winning BEAR combination with an all beef dog. I was drooling like a dog after the first bite\n\nThey have a whopping 10 signature dogs and 7 premium dogs. With sides and bottled soda pop to top off your dog. \n\nI can't express in enough words how faithful of a customer I will be at this location. I was sold after the first bite! The combinations may seem a bit strange to your hearing however I encourage you to put it aside and indulge. \n\nYou will NOT be sorry! Awesome
The best hands down fried pickles EVER! Hotdogs are AMAZING! And the doughnuts DELICIOUS. A must try place.
Just had my 1st hotdog here it's unlike any other hotdog I ever tried. It was really delicious I enjoy the BBQ taste and how the cracker jacks inside added to the flavoring. I would definitely come back to try what other hotdogs they have.
Love, love, love this place! Staff is always super friendly, and my chosen meal is always cooked perfectly. Very eclectic and diverse menu with options to build your own unique creation as well. Saddle on up to the counter for some yummy grub and good conversation with the staff. Try their spicy brat with chipotle cream cheese and diced bacon. Their potato salad is top notch, too. Not too happy that they don't have Rollover Donuts offered for dessert any more, though...bring them back!
The food is great, when they're open... I have gone to the Biltmore Fashion Park location four times now, well before their closing time, and they have been closed. The listed hours are until 8pm and I have gone between 5 and 6pm and they were already closed.This is really unacceptable. I wish they would stay true to their listed hours because the hotdogs are delicious.
They stopped selling kids dogs to adults although there is no age listed on the menu. I work in the mall and they pick and choose who can buy a kids dog. My coworker was able to buy one but I wasn't. They need to make it consistent, and not pick and choose who they allow to purchase a kids dog. I just watched them loose out on $15 because three other adults wanted a simple hotdog. $8 for a hotdog with ketchup & mustard is ridiculous. I don't see an issue with selling a \"simple\" \"naked\" hotdog for $5 dollars. \n\nFried pickles are bomb tho.
I like this place. Its small and little table space but the Dogs are great!\n\nA little pricey but I like it.  Can not go often because of the price.  \n\nThe Donuts are great also!! try one!\n\nI'll be back!
I am so sad to see that short leash will only be temporarily in this location! The service is great and the food is even better. I do not eat beef or pork but their chicken and veggie dog are the best I've had! I would recommended one of those with the sunny option, sans the prosciutto. I hope they will consider staying longer!!
Nothing special and pricey for what you get.\n\nOrdered my daughter corn dogs.  Menu says two, but they hadn't bothered to change the sign...and the manager didn't bother to apologize.\n\nSeriously, all it takes is a piece of white paper scissors and tape to change the menu board.\n\nTheir corn dog is half the size of \"everyday corn dog\" and twice the price.... considering its half the size it works out to 4 times the price.\n\nDo not understand what the fuss is about.  Have had people recommend the central Phoenix location.
I start this by saying yeah yeah yeah I know I just overpaid for this hot dog ($9), but (and it's a big BUT;) I had to give this place a try and I'm very glad I did!\n\nNo other place has all these different and imaginative offerings for hotdogs all in one place. Today I had the Cubano which comes with a smattering of pulled pork, cheese, mustard and spicy sweet pickles. I subbed the spicy dog for its less spicy but just as snappy cousin, the all beef dog.\n\nIf I was less hungry I would have taken 1/2 of it home with me.
This is the Short Leash in the Union at the Biltmore. I love this location because it really is the perfect place to grab an early 11 o'clock lunch and a dirty chai latte from Royal next door. Plus once you are done you can pop over to MAC and see what's new. I always do :) \n\nI've run into Brad a few times here and he's his usual, friendly, chipper self. There is nothing better than service with a smile!
Brad & Kat are at it again!  And they're back in my hood!  They have a new location at the Union at Biltmore right next to Stingray.  Check it out, they dogs are the best in Arizona!
The decor of this place is what originally reeled me in because I love dogs :)\nFood was very good ! I ordered a vegetarian Oliver and my boyfriend ordered the bratwurst stuffed pretzel with potato salad. Everything was delicious! The pickle on the side was so good and they make them in house.\nThe worker was wonderful too ! Very helpful with the menu items and very personable. He talked to us our entire time dining at Short Leash.
Been a regular but customer service has changed. Long wait time for mac and cheese and when I went to pick it up and the gentleman says \" thanks\" in a tone as if I was disturbing him and I just simply looked in the box because I almost couldn't see if anything was even in there and as I'm looking he goes \" thanks\" again. Used to love this place but I just can't anymore.
I just paid $18 for two hot dogs. I get the same thing at every golf course in town for $8. Everything was a la cart so I imagine that if we got a drink and chips it would be $40. \n\nNever again.
Just moved to Melrose and was excited to try this new restaurant via \u00fcbereats. I love gourmet hot dogs and this place looked super yummy!\nWe ordered the Lady and the Bear. The Lady was my favorite! Fried pickles and chipotle cream cheese somehow made utter, delicious yummy sense! The Bear I was slightly disappointed in, but it may have been because I opted for the meat version. It was definitely good but adding chicken may have affected the combination of flavors; I emphasize, the combo surprisingly still worked! Who would have thought peanut butter, cracker jacks, gouda, and bbq sauce would have made a winning combination?! This is why I applaud Short Leash! They took an old time American favorite and dressed it up to the nines! Not only were they experimental with their toppings but the Naan bread worked perfectly and I loved getting to choose Brats instead of the traditional hot dogs. If you are a more conservative eater I recommend eating somewhere else; if you're like me and like to eat new things, eat here. \nKeep experimenting with flavors and I will keep eating whatever you come up with!
Staff was friendly, food was good but I'm upset that I waited 25-30 minutes for a hot dog!! And definitely a bit overpriced.
Service is really good and in the colorful Roosevelt Row District. I gave 4 stars and not 5 because to be honest, this place didn't knock my socks off. I also really really like their menu, concept, and atmosphere. This is a great spot for your lunch break! I had the Mac daddy that has a hotdog, chili, and Mac n cheese along with the German potato salad that was surprisingly more stand outish than the hot dog!
We have ordered delivery from the 3 times now, within 1 month!  We love this place.  I have got my grandparents and parents hooked too!  Good portions and very tasty.  Our favorite is the Mongolian beef, yum!
Great place to eat in a pinch. I wasn't mobile and was here on business. Delivery was fast and food was great. Egg rolls were amazing. Needed more chicken. Don't know if I saw any but the flavor made me forget the lack of chicken. \n\nDumplings were great and tried the house pan fried noodles. Couldn't be happier. If the egg rolls had more meat they would have 5 stars. Still great and will eat here again.
Recently moved to the area. Tried this place out for the first time with their delivery service. Overall awesome service! Quality of the food was great, price was very reasonable as well, especially considering the portions received. \n\nWe ordered the chicken fried rice, General Tao's Chicken, and eggrolls. Everything was excellent; however,  the egg rolls were primarily cabbage. That being said, the eggrolls were crunchy and the cabbage tasted good. Will be ordering again in the future!
This place has good food and good prices.  Egg rolls could be better but not a deal breaker for me.  Lots of my coworkers also order from this place.
I get Star Wok when I am at work as I can't leave for lunch. If I forget my lunch (which is all the time) I can count on Star Wok to get me good food fast.
Fast service and polite service! Food was hot and delicious and they even remember that I asked for no ice in my drink! Will definately go back!
Unlike panda express this place cooks to order which is a good thing in my opinion. The combo with honey chicken, kung pao chicken, and white rice was very good.
Small little place, but is best for takeout when we don't want to cook. The food is good, way better than Panda Express! I always believe Chinese food needs to be cooked by Chinese people not Mexican. Will definately order again when we visit AZ!  Added bonus with the guy name Tony who took my order, he was very friendly and made sure we had enough. Thanks for you great service tony!
I ordered delivery from here 2 nights ago and the food was great. I ordered the fried chicken and pork short ribs in orange sauce. The fried chicken was a little bit dry but still tasty. Their rice was actually the weakest point of the meal because it was really dry. \n\nThe delivery came about 5 mins late and the driver apologized immediately. I'm assuming he got lost in my neighborhood, which was no big deal. I found it charming that he seemed to sweat the 5 mins more than I did. \n\nOverall though, I would order from here again. \n\nPros: Good serving sizes, good price, tasty food.\n\nCons: Long wait time for the delivery (60 mins from order time to delivery time), dry rice.
Great prices. Beyond great food. Friendly staff. COOKED TO ORDER 5 FEET FROM YOUR FACE. hello!?!? Tell me where you can get all these great things all under one roof?!? 5 stars!!!
Everything was great... I devoured the food. We got combs and I was totally impressed.
I've had delivery from here 3 times now and the food is always delicious and the delivery is always super fast! I love this place!!
Place is great and price is very fair and made fresh every time I've ordered. Homemade egg rolls are far and tasty the portions are good and very filling.
Great prices and the food was prepared quickly for us to pick up. It was still very hot when we got it despite being held up by traffic. The guy helping me was super polite and made sure we had forks, and the plates they gave us were a very nice addition. \n\nUnfortunately, the food was not great. We had 3 entrees and got a side of fried rice with each entree. I've never had fried rice before that had nothing in it: there were no eggs, no meat of any kind, no vegetables. The rice itself tasted funky, totally bland with an aftertaste like maybe the rice was old. \n\nThe General Tso's and sweet & sour pork were both totally bland without the sauce. The sweet & sour pork was a little over done, but the veggies for the could have been cooked longer, they were practically raw. \n\nThe best part of our meal was the cashew chicken. The sauce had good flavor, veggies were almost perfect and the chicken was tender. But it wasn't good enough to bring us back.
One word: AMAZING! The food we have gotten from there has always been hot, perfectly cooked, and exactly what I'm looking for in terms of flavor. The egg rolls by far surpass every other place I have been to in Phoenix, the fried rice has never been dry, and the veggies are always crisp and never soggy or gross. I have tried their chicken, beef, and pork and have never been dissatisfied. Just a great place to eat. Thank you!
I ate here for the first time asked for Chicken chop suey they gave me chicken lo mein. The sweet n sour had a metallic after taste. Don't think I will order again. :(
You should be able to give 0 stars! \nI ordered egg foo young, General Tso chicken and chicken chop suey at 3:17pm and was told 10 minutes. I got caught in traffic and didn't arrive until 15 minutes later at approximately 3:32pm. He, cashier, asked my name and then said it was coming right up. 3:40pm still no food- and he asks me my name Again! No food ready but asked if I could pay now. I asked him if my order had even been started. But I'm pretty sure you guessed correctly.......it had not- he was unapologetic, offered nothing in lieu of my time, not an egg roll, not a won ton- just a complimentary look of indifference. I love good food but I work hard for my money and nothing leaves a bad taste in my mouth like paying for bad service! I can get my Chinese food fix somewhere else where the customers are treated with respect.
Want friendly service, good prices, safe location? Don't stop,keep going! Located in a strip mall near a smoke shop and a QT many unsavory characters milling around. Recently moved nearby and explained that I like Chinese food and need a go to place for my fix. I ordered the lunch special take-out. Thinking they would like my return business, they would make my order especially robust. WRONG! Upon opening, found egg rolls missing, small scoop of fried rice and lo mien and 2 small pieces of beef with broccoli and as a bonus...all cold and bland. Also missing, fork, napkins, condiments and the traditional fortune cookie. No drink order. Total, almost $9! WOW. No wonder it's always empty of customers. Too bad! :-(
might be the worst chinese food I've ever had!\nspent nearly $40 on delivery.   so dissapointed.\nhow can you possibly screw up orange chicken? you did...... soggy, flavorless mush.\n  I guess your answer to fried rice is to just drown white rice in soy.    can't believe you have any repeat customers? how are you even open for business.\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE
Delicious delicous delicous! Friendly staff, and very generous portions on every order. I don't live in Arizona but I do travel to the state at least 3-5 times a year and when I do I stop by here to fulfill my chinese food cravings. 4.5-5 stars for great food and awesome service.
Disgusting! Rice is dry, veggies over cooked, Taos chicken was so disgusting my pet wouldn't even touch it. My wife had veggies and it looked liked someone had pre-chewed it for her. The sight of the food was just completely unappealing. NEVER ordering food from here again.
Just disappointed, ordered mongolian beef and orange chicken and egg roll. First, mongolian beef. Taste burnt and u can tell it is not fresh. Orange chicken, taste so good! BUT its not fresh. And egg roll. It is big!! And taste amazing!! Fresh and crispy!! But the main dish is so disappointed :( i love the taste honestly. It is good combo with rice coz i love rice and i eat everythng with rice. I stopped eating coz the chicken and beef is so chewy and like a rubber. I will try another menu next time.
Located in the miracle mile shop connected to elara, planet hollywood, etc. Food is overpriced and not good. I got an Italian sandwich, there was barely any meat in it. If you're in the miracle mile shop area, I recommend lobster me or earl of sandwich.
I really hate writing bad reviews but I am left with little option when the best thing about this place is their Coke machine.  It is one of those where you can customize all these flavor add-ins.  \n\nTheir meatballs are not too good. I ordered the Original, and even though the flavor was acceptable, it had some kind of grisly bits in it.  I have no idea what it was, but it had a most unpleasant texture.  I was too scared to take it out of my mouth and look at it, so I did the next best thing...I swallowed it.  The meat sauce that it came with was almost as bad - salty and no flavor.  But I did find it amazing that the vegetables I ordered tasted just like the ones served at my school cafeteria.  How do you take carrots, broccoli, and squash, and boil the shit out it so that they all taste the same? I tried to force myself to finish those, but was prevented from doing so by the pieces of broccoli bark.  Seriously, you are not supposed to cut up and serve the base of the broccoli.  It is too woody and fibrous.  I must look like a beaver.  They also had some pizzas on display, but ironically, they did not look as tasty as the meatballs.\n\nBut the family that owns it is very nice.  I will continue to buy my sodas from them in the future.
Loved their meatball sliders!  So cute.  We got some with the standard marinara, and some with the parmesan cheese sauce, which is delicious and decadent!  Also, kinda messy.
Try the classic for sure. Not a large selection but seems to be all full of flavor. They do leave the counter unattended sometimes ...
I was leaning toward a three star, but the more I thought about their name I realized I couldn't go three. They are called the Meatball Spot and the meatball just isn't special. It isn't a bad meatball, but it isn't good either.\n\nWe first visited this spot when they had a restaurant in Town Square and thought it was okay. Saturday we decided to give them another try at this location and see if our feelings had changed about the food.\n\nWe went with meatball sliders, one traditional and one pork. The sauce was spicy Italian sauce. First, the slider rolls are just not hardy enough for the large meatball and the sauce. The buns were mush instantly and that wasn't the most appetizing. The meatball wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. The meatballs have zero in the way of seasoning. They are essentially a giant hunk of meat (which usually is a good thing), but meatballs should be seasoned! Forgive me, I'm Italian so this seems like a sin against meatballs.\n\nThe line at this location was really slow as well. Everything was prepared in the assembly line and yet it took at least ten minutes for the three people in front of us to be served. None of the customers seemed to be doing anything that would delay service either. The people behind us in line were complaining about the wait as well.\n\nI may seem really down on this place, but it would be okay for a quick lunch or dinner. It really isn't awful, but in my opinion there are too many good food options in Vegas to devote a meal to this spot.
This place is absolute rubbish. The meatballs were bad. The bread was not good. And the sauce was not good either. \n\nOn top of the food tasting bad the service was really poor. The server was really rude and unresponsive. If you are at Planet Hollywood I would suggest somewhere else within the miracle mall, if you're looking for late night of cheap lunch/dinner.
Amazing food and awesome service!!! Ate at the seafood place right next too it for 3X the money and this place was AMAZING compared to them! Came back the next day too!!
Went in on Saturday AM of July 4th weekend. Sorry, we are out of marinara. Who eats meatballs without marinara? We have pizza though.  Changing name to Might Have Meatballs Pizza Spot!!
Perfect quick bite. Didn't know what to order and woman working there could not have been nicer and nailed exactly what I needed. Had turkey meatball sub with classic tomato. Basic but hit the spot. Really great service and nice to deal with someone so nice. Wish the coke machine was working as regular coke unavailable but I am better off with water anyway.
Classic meatballs with classic tomato sauce are great tasting and fulfilling.  We ordered four meatballs and they tasted like homemade meatballs.  We came here twice and it was delicious each time.
Just walking around Planet Hollywood looking for a quick bite to eat before we hit the pool party. I wasn't as hungry as I normally am in the morning, so I just wanted something light. Especially, if I was going to a pool party. Shouldn't stuff your face before a pool party in Vegas. Haha\n\nAnyhow, it's a stand located in the shopping area of PH. You can make Meatball subs, sliders, pasta, or just eat it from a cup. They serve bread sticks, salads, and even pizza. There are four types of meatballs they serve: Classic (beef, chicken and veal?); Pork; Chicken; and Turkey. You can choose the type of sauce you want over your meatballs.\n\nI went with the Turkey and tomato sauce with my slider. It was pretty tasty. didn't have much of an appetite so one slider was enough for me. Give it a try.
Amazing meatballs that fall apart in your mouth.  By far some of the cheapest best eats in Vegas!
Last night was my first time trying the Meatball Spot.  I ordered a three meatball sandwich for $6.95.  It seemed expensive and I figured it would be a small sandwich.  It was actually just right.  I got the classic meatballs and these are no tiny little Spaghetti-O's style meatballs.  These are balls with substance.  They tasted fresh and were quite juicy.  So often I get a meatball sandwich that tastes old and microwaved.  Not here.\n\nKeeping it classic, I ordered classic sauce too.  It looked thin but was by no means watered down.  This was a full flavor marinara that was even a little bit spicy.  A very good compliment to the meatballs.\n\nThe bread of my sandwich was fine.  Nothing spectacular.  It was there mostly to catch the sauce.  It executed this task with some competancy but I still went through several napkins because of the dripping sauce.\n\nThis was a good sandwich.  My only complaint was the $1 price tag to add cheese.  I skipped the cheese for that reason.  I'm sorry but I think a meatball should come with cheese included.  Subway has jaded me.
Website link is broken, menu shown in pictures not for this location. Really disappointed that they only offered pasta, rigatoni  to ne exact. Website for The Meatball Spot shown madhed potatoes and potenta, not here. I was so disappointed  I left without ordering and plannon making the management  of Planet Hollywood  aware of the lack of consistency and produts offered.
Really good meatball sandwich. Purchased the classic meatballs with the spicy sauce. The roll was tasty and fresh enough. Will return.
Well tonight, my first time at this location, I enjoyed the Classic Spicy Meatball sub.  Pretty good I must say.  Came served nice and hot!  I do miss the old location at Town Square but at least we have a sorts of Meatball Spot back in action.  The seating is great for people watching too-  you know there's a few characters that go see Britney ;) ).\n\nGood service and I love that Soda machine.  Pick what you want to drink and push the button.  Perfect.\n\nI'll be back asap to try something else when I want to be bad on my diet- maybe one of the Parmesan sauces!
My girlfriend and I were on our way to the Britney Spears show and we were running late so we couldn't go to dinner and we were starving!\n\nWe ended up hitting up this spot and ordering two slices of pizza, although they were only pepperoni pizza they were pretty amazing!\n\nThe bread was tasty, the sauce tasted great, and the pepperoni was just right! \n\nWant a quick bite to eat, grab a slice of pizza from this spot!
Great choice!  For a quick bite and some tasty meatballs, this is a good choice.  I tried one chicken meatball in the mushroom gravy (yum), and one classic with a mix of the parmesan cream and basic tomato sauce.  Both good!  A two meatball combo is only $4 and came with an asiago breadstick. \n\nI also got the cheese flatbread, which wasn't much to speak of.  Not bad, but not good either.  Not worth changing the rating though, since the meatballs were what I came for. \n\nReasonable price, tasty meatballs and that cool 100 flavor come machine.  Is recommend it and I will likely be back. There's pasta and cheddar cheese sauce which I'd love to try.
Wow, great stuff. These had to be the some of the most tender meatballs I have ever eaten. They were wonderful. Great job.
Meatballs in a cup are bomb. The spicy meat sauce and Parmesan cream are amazing. Great meal if you're in a hurry. Meatball heaven
Best & Simple & cheaper food...we had veggie pizza and cheese pizza. Both were awesome at reasonable price.
Meatballs do hit the spot!  \n\nMy girls and I wanted something light before heading to bikini day club land so we encountered this and decided on it. It surely satisfied semi hunger and I have to admit, the meatballs, which I opted for turkey, chicken and pork was amazingly delicious! Add on the choice of cream with mushrooms, then you will thank me!  They offer a baked, garlic breadstick with the cup of meatballs - great for soaking up the creamy goodness!  They have pizzas and sammies, but I don't know why you would order that when the shop is called meatball spot.\n\nYUMMY for some meatballs here!
I don't know how the food is because I walked away due to horrible, and I mean horrible customer service. I am a local, and my mother in law was visiting which brought us naturally to the strip. They stood out to us because there was not a long line and we were starving. \nI walked up to the cash register and there was a group of three sitting on the other end having what apparently was an extremely in depth and important conversation. I assumed someone would come to take my order because one girl watched me walk to the register. Not one of them asked how I was doing, what could they get for me, or if I had even been there before. Lastly, no one even said Hello. \nMyself and my mother in law decided to leave and look at other food places, and found ourselves back at the Meatball Spot and had a question on the Flat Breads.\nI asked \" Are the flatbreads cheaper if they are sliced smaller?\" I also had my 3 year old son with me, which is why I asked.\nShe said nothing and threw a very large flatbread in the oven and proceeded to continue her conversation with her other two rude friends. I said excuse me, because I wasn't sure if she actually understood what I was asking. I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page. Their conversation continues, so I literally wave my hands back and forth like I was trying to wave down a taxi, better yet, like I was helping to land a plane ( this place is tiny like a subway, so they had to see me) . They guy in the conversation looks me in my eyes, and looks away laughing and continuing his conversation.....well as soon as the oven beeped and she took the pizza out of the oven to turn around and ask me to pay I walked away. I refused to hand my money over to people who could care less that I was there or not. \n\nHopefully none of those people were a manager. That would be horrible representation.
Have your breakfast or lunch made by Stow's own Ron Swanson (aka owner Ed)! Trust me when you go you'll know what I mean. Never had to wait for a good breakfast here. The lunches are so-so but I've never been a fan of diner lunches anyway so I may be biased (I hear the soup is great). The service isn't overtly friendly but they're speedy and they've never made an error on my meals once in the many times I've come. Ed even made me a specially made turkey Reuben after giving me a hard time asking \"is it on the menu?\" It has a cute retro 50s look to it (although some things could use a good dusting) complete with diner counter and little bar stools. Overall a good, hot, cheap local breakfast spot!
Cool little place. Exactly what u expected. Cheap, good food and a cool small diner feel. If that's what your looking for this is a great spot
This place probably had one of the best atmospheres and food of any of the many breakfast joints in town. I am an avid breakfast eater and this Isalys II has become a staple in our weekly lives.
Perfect, tiny, little diner.\n\nIf you're looking for an old-school feel, and just simplicity in your life one morning, come on into here. They certainly have their regulars who are just a couple of older gentlemen that sit at the bar and order their \"usuals\" (usually black coffee and some toast). I think this place has pizazz. When I'm craving a good, cheap, old-fashioned breakfast and just want to quiet the craziness in my life, this is where I go. It has a 50's vibe, just because it's so laid-back and simple, which I love.
I hadn't been here in years because of the service and prior bad experiences with the food not being prepared correctly. I went to meet a friend for breakfast. The scrambled eggs were very over cooked and like rubber. The hash browns had very little flavor and under seasoned.
Lived in the area for years and years and never knew this place was around.  They only do breakfast and lunch, and now they're closed on Sundays, which is a little odd.  A lot of people (like us) only get a chance to go out to breakfast on the weekends, so I'd think that that would cut into their business, but they seem to be doing fine, so what do I know?  Most days are \"seat yourself,\" so there's always interesting jockeying for position if there's a wait.  Counter seating is fun for kids to watch the goings-on in the open kitchen.  \n\nNever had any lunch items, but breakfast is always consistently good, and the servers are fast with a coffee refill.  As the previous review says, there's only one cook at the grill, so things can get a little slow sometimes.  Just chat with the people you came with or bring a book if you're solo.
Tried to go there this morning as I keep on hearing about their breakfast.\n\nPulled in at 7:25. The sign says 7-2, the hours on this site says the same... but not a soul stirred in the darkened restaurant.
Delicious, very reasonably priced food. Italy's II is tucked away in a back corner- we've driven by often but only this morning found it online. Our waiter was friendly & courteous. The owners are working alongside with a couple young people- not a hoitytoity place at all! We will definitely come back!\nThe one drawback was the smell of glue that was very strong. This is because a new roof was being put on. It did NOT detract from a great tasting breakfast though!
Lunch on 12/7/11...a bad choice. Not crowded@ about 1:30 p.m. We always sit in the bar area. Not a good idea to have the bartender wait tables. First...ordered a glass of Sutter Home Pinot Grigio. Was told \"we don't have that now\" and was offered Little Black Dress Pinot. I asked if it was the same price as the Sutter Home..told it wasn't but was advised she would \"give it to me at that price today because I was having a bad day\". Why should I pay more for an \"upsell\" when they didn't have what was on the menu?  Ordered sandwich with fries. Received my meal and the fries were old, shriveled and barely warm..so were my husband's. Obviously, we were given the leftovers from lunch that had been sitting under the heat lamp. Asked for and received freshly made, hot fries. The manager approached our table asking how everything was. I let him know what had transpired. He seemed totally disinterested but he did comp my lunch. The bartender/waitress came with our check and she basically admitted that we were served the \"leftovers\" from the early lunch service. This Applebees has gone downhill in the past several years. We used to have lunch here quite often in the late 1990's but we will not be back. Things have steadily deteriorated the past couple of times we've been here. I don't think it's too much to ask for hot fries and to have an item you offer on the menu. Another example of the lack of quality and concern by chain restaurants!!!!'hmmm
This is the worst Applebees I have been too. I went with 5 friends and our waitress was really rude. We all already had two beverages and we did buy food, when we asked for a third round she questioned how many drinks we had, and said well I guess you guys can have another one since you bought food. Then shortly after I received my watered down jagger bomber the waitress came and said are you ready for your tickets? ... right after we received our drinks, we were basically shoved out and didn't feel welcomed at all. Every other Applebees I have never had a problem but this one is just horrible!
I have always liked Applebee's. From their food to the service it's definitely deserves a 4 star rating in my book. My husband and I stopped for supper tonight. Tonight was burger night, that meant you could get any burger and fries for $6.99. As enticing as that sounded we decided to order off the 2 for $20 menu. You get one appetizer and certain menu choices for 20 dollars. Our appetizer was the spinach artichoke dip with tortilla chips. This dip is so good. Warm and creamy. The entree I chose was the chicken tenders and fries. It comes with your choice of ranch, honey mustard or bbq sauce. I chose the honey mustard. The chicken strips are good, the breading is lightly seasoned. The fries are crispy, but over salted and seasoned for my taste. The honey mustard sauce is thick, creamy and not too sweet. It's perfect.\nThe service is great. Tonight the place was busy, but our server never faltered on checking on us and making sure we were taken care of. I will be back as this is one of my favorite restaurants,
August 27, 2013  5:15pm. I ordered the 7 oz sirloin medium rare with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The veggies were fine, so was the service.\n\nThe water in my glass was nasty metallic tasting. My steak was easily the worst meat I've ever been served in my life. It was an odd looking long banana-shaped thing that did not taste like beef at all. Maybe it was goat or horse but IT WAS NOT BEEF.\n\nIt sort of tasted like the jerked goat burgers I had in Jamaica. I've been eating beef my entire life, this tasted nothing like, looked nothing like, and had the consistency nothing like any beef I've ever had, in my life.\n\nDon't think I'll be going back there. Ever.\n\nI did not want to complain at the store because there is no coming back from being served a piece of meat like this, it should have never been served to a human customer. Complaining only jeopardizes your safety in any restaurant. Never send food back to the kitchen for replacement is my philosophy. We simply cut short our visit and got the hell out without saying a word. I'll express my displeasure by never returning.
I really want to like this Applebee's but I just don't. I keep trying and am disappointed every time. We recently went there for dinner and the service was AWFUL. They were sort of busy but not THAT busy. We placed an order for an appetizer which came out after our meal was served. This is the THIRD time this has happened there. I don't understand why this is so difficult to get right!? Our waitress gave a pathetic , \"Eh, sorry\" and walked away. You could at least ACT like you cared a smidgen. No drink refills either, which irked me.\n\nLunch is somewhat better. At least the service is, anyway. I do love their all you can eat salad and soup at lunch. \n\nI am also not sure why, but the ice tea at this Applebee's and at the IHOP across the street taste funny. Maybe the water? Apparently other people have commented on it as well, because the wait staff have agreed some people notice that taste. \n\nIt is a slightly longer drive to go to the Applebees on Gilbert, but I feel like the service is definitely better there, and that is where we will be going from now on.
Headed to Applebee's with my family for the first time in a long time last night.... I ordered the chipotle chicken strips with macaroni and cheese off of the two for 25 menu and my food was served to me lukewarm and the macaroni Tasted old. When I complain in a nice way my waiter took my meal back to the kitchen and the other two people in my party pretty much had their dinner done by the time my food finally came back.   and when it came back it was piping hot and very good.   I was thinking that the manager would come over because I had to send my food back or that the server would comp  my meal or give us a free dessert none of that happened    pretty disappointing.  We will not go back to Applebee's at all especially this one
Something about this particular Applebee's is off-putting. The food wasn't as good as others, the interior wasn't as inviting and like others, the waiters would all meet up at the bar and talk to each other until someone walked in to be seated.\n\nWould be ideal if they moved out and they were replaced. Will try to avoid it.
First time at this Mesa, AZ Applebees. Wonderful service, thanks Kailani! My moms salad was made just right and my chicken tenders and fries were perfect. We splurged and had the triple chocolate melt desert. Wow! Loved it! I'm from Charleston, SC and I will be backi to this Mesa Applebees when I come to visit!
Why is this place busy?  Burger and salmon were both over cooked; third entre presentation was blah. Service was slow but friendly. Used up a $50 gift card on 3 meals and one dessert so no need to go back!
I like Applebee's. It's my wife's favorite restaurant. I go for we go there. You get two entrees and an appetizer to split. Tonight we got the 2 for 20. Mine was the quesadilla burger, hers was the chicken tenders. The order came with French fries. Our appetizer was the spinach artichoke dip with nacho chips. As always the dip was good. Creamy and smooth, almost want to just eat it with a spoon good. I ordered the quesadilla burger which was my first time ordering this. This is a hamburger wrapped in a quesadilla made with Monterey Jack cheese. The burger was cooked perfectly to my specifications. It was sandwiched in a quesadilla composed of melted cheese, Pico de Gallo. and grilled flour tortilla. It was a good burger. The only thing that would have made it a 5 star burger would have been chipotle or taco seasoning on the burger. As it was it was a little bland. I got some Tabasco to spice it up a little. The fries were crispy not soggy. I hate soggy. \nThe service was excellent. It was a full house tonight and Samantha was right there servicing out table as if we were the only ones there. The restrooms were clean and well maintained. This one is a keeper in my book giving it a 4 star rating.
serously my son and I had the chipote steak, it was so salty I couildn't eat it.  yuk
Not so happy, happy hour at this Applebee's. \n\nHappy hour is awesome typically at any Applebee's, but the amount of time it took for us to get everything we ordered was disappointing. When we were first seated it took our waitress about 10 minutes to even acknowledge that we were new customers waiting to give our order. Once we ordered our drinks it took another 10 minutes to have them delivered (2 beers isn't a mix drink that a bartender has to create, right out of the tap, should have taken 5 minutes tops). When our waitress finally delivered our drinks, she ran to the table dropped the bees off and darted away, at this time we were ready to order our food and she didn't even ask us if we were ready. After flagging her down we were finally able to order our food. After about 35 minutes we flagged her down again for she had walked past our table several times and didn't give us an update about what was taking so long, nor ask us if we wanted another round of drinks. Once our food finally came out, things didnt get any better. The buffalo wings were tasty, but my steak was dry and tough. The mashed potatoes and broccoli that came along with my steak wasn't awful tasting, but also nothing special. My friend ordered a burger and said the same thing. It's just a burger nothing awesome about it but nothing nasty about it.\n\nIm sure the kitchen gets backed up during happy hour, but that is when the waiters and waitresses should be on their toes checking on their tables to put the wait for food at ease. At this time the cooks need to make sure they still care about food quality and not worry so much about just getting the food out the door.\n\n*Currently looking for a happy, happy hour place*
Well all I can say is the 3 times a year I go to Applebee's I have been satisfied with my meal and the service is decent as well .yesterday I sat in the bar and had the nachos as I said I thought they were good and the waitperson was polite and \nEffeciant
I have stayed away from Applebee's for several years as they ALWAYS made a mistake on my order. I always order car side to go. I am a busy professional and I eat out quite frequently. I placed my order. As always, my order was not on time. (When I placed my order online I was given a time it would be ready ) I waited a good 10minutes before I was acknowledged. I received my order in another 15minutes. I get home and I find out that they messed up my order. Mind you it's 115 degrees outside and I live about 15-20min away. I call the store to speak with a manager. She offered to remake my meal and I would travel to go pick it up or she could report it to Corporate and they would send me something. It was hot out and I was tired. I opted for Corporate to send me something. I received two $5 coupons. The audacity...the insult!! I am sure I spent close to $40 on my order. The $5 coupon is a slap in the face! I will not take time out of my day to order a meal and be treated poorly as a customer! I had the expectation that my meal would be replaced and not at my expense! #WorstExperienceEver #LostMeAsACustomer
Yes, yes I am really giving it a 5 star rating. First off let me start out by saying we had a $10 buck gift card and that is really what prompted the visit. \n\nI ordered the clubhouse grill with no bacon. It has turkey and ham with a BBQ sauce. I wasn't expecting it to be a melt but it hit the spot. Managed to take a picture.  That and fries with two sides of ranch and I was in heaven. My husband had the endless soup and salad lunch special. First up for him was French onion soup and a spinach and shrimp salad. Next the chilly and an Asian chicken salad. Both were great and although we had not planned on getting desert our awesome waitress who filled my water glass a million times without me noticing talked us into brownie bites for 99 cents. So cute these small triangle brownies and one scoop of ice cream. I wish I would have remembered my camera. The place was clean the food was good and the service was great!  I wasn't expecting to give it 5 stars but it really couldn't have gone any better. Delicious!
These guys are great. They come out to my car so I don't have to leave my babies to run in. $5 dollar pizza in 10 seconds. Feeds our whole family. Can't beat it.
It's pretty gross, but just barely edible and if you drown it in ranch it's not bad.  ---Yelpers give me a break I was buzzed and it was only $5 bucks.
I just waited 30 minutes for a hot and ready. I had no warning that they were that behind. Very frustrating run to Little Cesar's.
Yes, I bribe my students with pizza parties. It effectively motivates them to work hard. This pizza is cheap and the students always gobble it up. I personally don't eat it, but I'm a pizza snob. Thanks for making a cheap pizza that kids love!
Based on last night's meal, and easy Five yelp stars.  This may be unfair because I have been to this restaurant so many times over the last eight years and I know what I like and what to avoid!  This food is extremely consistent!  Every time each dish is as it was on previous visits.  \n\nFirst I ordered Fresh Rolls! These are the largest Fresh Rolls of any place I have been!  Their \"Peanut\" Sauce is the most unique, House-made for sure, super thin, sweet and sour with minced peanuts on top.  The Fresh Rolls earn 4.5 stars and the Peanut Sauce gets 4.1 stars.\n\nOne of my Favorite Thai Dishes (when it is done well) is stir fried Thai Basil with Beef (my friends and I call it Basil Beast)!  What I like about Thai Orchids approach to Beef Basil is the beef is very good, it has very few other ingredients, Garlic, Peppers, Soy based sauce and Thai Basil.  This simple recipe yields one of my favorite versions of this dish!  The Rice is Jasmine I think.  This dish gets an easy 5 yelp stars every time I have eaten it here!!!\n\nFor Dessert, Custard with Sticky Rice!  Tastes much better than my photo conveys.  I'm glad I got it though would not order it without a couple of people to share it with and last night I ate it all!!!  I have to keep reminding myself I'm on a diet!
Gross. We ordered three entrees and had them delivered by Door Dash. The Pad Thai was the best out of the three, but still mediocre. The stir fry veggie with chicken smelled like a horses stable and had my son spitting it back out on to his plate; he eats anything. Mine was the orange chicken and I promise you it was not chicken. I'm praying we don't all get sick.
Love it here! Pad thai is awesome and my wife loves the red curry. I recommend those two items highly. The owner is a great guy and I guarantee you'll enjoy your evening there.
This is the best Thai food Ive had in the States. The Tom Kha soup is on point, the perfect balance of savory and sweet. I had amazing curry and they even had the traditional Thai dessert.... mango and sticky rice! This is the best Thai restaurant in Charlotte. Don't go anywhere else for Thai food!!!!
Thai Orchid is absolutely my favorite Thai restaurant in Charlotte.  I have been going there for 10 years and have never had less than a fantastic experience.  The staff are friendly, service is quick, and the food knocks out all of the competition.  The atmosphere is less sophisticated (but more interesting) than pricier Thai restaurants whose food cannot compare.  They are also really helpful and knowledgeable when customers have dietary restrictions.
DO NOT EAT here!!! We ordered last night. My boyfriend hadn't eatin since lunch around noon. He got home late and we went to pick up the food around 8pm. He got the number 20 with seafood. About an hour later he spent the entire night throwing up and having diarrhea. I called first thing in the morning to warn them and the manager was EXTREMELY rude. Didn't care and kept saying \"well what can I do about it\" I told him he probably should not sell that batch of soup and at least refund that meal. He would not do anything and said there is no way of knowing it was from his food. So disappointed, what awful service.
Even the Pad Thai which had tasted great on our first visit now it's not so good. Maybe the chef only works dinners because like on our last visit the food tasted reheated. In fact the sprouts and vegetables were totally limp as if they had the life zapped out of them by the microwave and the dish tasted kind of boring. \n\nI won't be back.
This restaurant helped me find my love for thai food.  The fresh rolls with tofu are my absolute favorite.  I could eat them every day.  Love that this is a hidden gem, tucked away in a shopping center not seen from the main road.
This place still has some of the best lunch specials in the Southpark area.  Before I spent two weeks in Thailand, I thought it was great.  Now I just think it is one of the best choices in Charlotte.
I had ordered yellow curry fried rice..and when I opened the take out box was shocked to see the so called fried rice with just shredded chicken and just \"2\" raw shrimps on top.... Never expected this from Thai orchid and you charge 14 dollar for this!!!!! Will never visit again !!
Authentic Thai cuisine that's very reasonably priced, they've been around the neighborhood forever and are always delivering awesome quality at great prices.
Thai Orchid is an OK Thai restaurant.  The lunch specials are moderately priced and small enough for you to not want to take a nap right after eating.  I mainly get the Pad Thai when I visit because it's usually the 1 out of 4 dishes I recognize on the menu.  I've had better, but it's decent. \n\nToday I was happy to see that they had Pad Prik King (or Pad Prig King depending on the restaurant) on their lunch menu today so that is what I ordered.  Next to the item it indicated it was of medium heat (spice wise) and I was fine with that because I can tolerate some pretty good heat.  When it came in front of me I was happy to dive in!  My first bite started off with a good flavor....until about 3 seconds later when the heat hit.  Holy moly, it was so hot I almost started to cry right in front of my co-workers!  I thought maybe I picked up a Thai Chili by accident in that bite, so I drank some water and had some plain rice to cool down the fire and tried again....MISTAKE!  I couldn't believe how spicy it was!  I couldn't even eat the spring roll that comes with the lunch because the heat (temperature) from the spring roll was only making it worse!  I asked a co-worker to try it just to make sure for some reason that my tolerance for spice today wasn't lowered, but he couldn't eat it as well!  He can sit in front of me and eat a raw jalapeno seeds and all and not even flitch and he couldn't stomach this dish.  \n\nI've ordered the Pad Prik King for dinner once and definitely know that it wasn't nearly as spicy as it was today!  It was actually quite tasty and that was why I was excited to see it as a lunch special.\n\nUsually Thai Orchid is ok, especially for a quick lunch and it's proximity from our office, but I really can't see myself coming back here.  Next time I'll stick with what I know and travel a little further to my favorite Thai restaurant in the Dil'!
Ok I really hated writing this review, but I had to.  I used to come to this place for lunch, and although not the best Thai I ever had, it was ok.  I never had a BAD experience.\n\nWell...the other night, I got take out and it was not good. It couldn't even squeak by as decent.  And I don't like to say that, because everyone at this place is nice, the restaurant is inviting, but this was awful. \n\nI ordered pad kee mao...like usual.  I got onions only on top. The order came out quickly, and I was greeted by very friendly people.  They took my order, I paid and got the food in a matter of minutes.  I went right home to eat only to find my noodles were so dry and sticky.  They stuck together and almost formed balls due to the stickiness. There was no sauce at all.  I was so disappointed.  I honestly only had two bites and had to throw it away. \n\nIt's a pricey meal to have to throw away.  And it really upset me.  I think that it will be the last time trying this place. I just can't anymore.  It's very unfortunate.
Great place. We've been there three times now. Very tasty thai. Great prices. Good service. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the location is bland.
Food is good. Atmosphere is nice. This place is definitely hidden. I would of never heard of it or went if it wasn't for our living social deal. I got the pad kee Mao and it was flavorful. Husband got the curry. Only complaint I have is that my meal came with several vegetables in it and I only requested onions. They charged me a $1 extra for that. I have no idea why since it was just a substitution and wasn't asking for anything extra. Other than that, it was good.
The best Thai food in Charlotte.  I have been a customer ever since the owners ran a Thai restaurant on Central Ave.  I used to travel to Asia a good deal and one of my Thai customers visited me here in Charlotte.  I tried taking him to several different Charlotte restaurants, but he always pulled out a bottle of tabasco sauce that he carried with him.  Taking the hint I decided to take him to Thai Orchid and he was extremely impressed.  He ordered all the dishes Thai native spicy and we ate outside in the 95 degree heat. (this was back in the day when they had an outdoor patio).  I would have rather eaten inside, but he was as happy as a clam eating spicy food outside in the middle of July.  He loved their food and said it was the best meal he had eaten since he had been in the US.\n\nSome of my favorites are:  mee krob, squid salad, chicken larb, kang dang curry, green curry special, pad thai and the boneless chicken wings.\n\nThe service is very friendly as well -- they don't call Thailand the \"land of smiles\" for nothing, and these folks carry on that tradition.
The food at Thai Orchid is mediocre - period- full stop. I've been an occasional customer for years and I have never had a dish I would consider well-prepared with quality ingredients. Why do I return? Because of convenience - I live within walking distance and sometimes we want something quick to bring home to eat. The other evening we picked up cold duck salad, crispy fried rolls, Thum Yum soup, and a #38 ginger and veggies with beef. A new low for us. The soup was flavorless; the duck salad was missing the advertised crispy noodles, and the #38 was filling, but boring with limp flavorless vegetables. Plenty of ginger though. The rolls were crisp, but lacked any depth of flavor.
We hit up this quaint little spot last night to celebrate the birthday of Mr. Poprock Photography. :D  Needless to say, it's nestled away in a shopping center that pops up out of nowhere (especially in the dark).\n\nIt's really small, but adorable! I felt like I was walking into someone's home.  At 7 PM, they weren't busy; it was a bit awkward for it to be so quiet, even with music playing in the background.\n\nLuckily, Tonya & Billy are foodies like my boyfriend & I, so we sampled quite a few of Thai Orchid's offerings.  \n\nFresh rolls: Heaven on a plate. I am such a big fan of fresh (spring) rolls & these were amazing.  First of all, they were HUGE! Packed tight & full of ingredients. The peanut sauce was spicy & hot & a perfect compliment.\n\nSpring rolls: Just the right amount of crunch & ingredients. The spicy sauce was hot & spicy, too.\n\nChicken wings: Cooked perfectly & again, the accompanied sauce was yes, hot & spicy!  Tonya & I both agreed it would have been tastier if they tossed the wings in the sauce prior to serving. Maybe next time, we can ask politely. :)\n\nI had the shrimp fried rice, which wow, the medium sized plate was overflowing with rice goodness.  I was a little taken a back due to having tomato chunks in it, as well as the shrimp having their tails still on.  Due to snacking away on appetizers, I was unable to finish my rice, but Shawn will enjoy it for lunch. \n\nShawn, Tonya & Billy all enjoyed their dishes of flounder, jasmine rice, & Chicken Pad Phed.  \n\nOur waitress was nice & checked on us just the right amount.  Our water glasses stayed full.\n\nLike Nicole, I am giving 3.5 stars, but bumping up to 4 for the appetizers & portions.
I had a hankering for Thai food and thought I would stop in. It's tucked in to a little shopping mall, so it's a little hard to find. The food was VERY good and the service was excellent. It's nice and quiet and clean.\nMy dining partner and I had fried tofu, Thai tea, and tom kha soup. Delicious!!\nWe did have to ask for spices for our food and for straws, etc. Otherwise, excellent, near perfection.
We used to live in Strawberry Hill when we first moved to Charlotte, and haven't been back to Thai Orchid since then (don't know why?). Checked it out again & I'm glad we did.\n\nWe started with the fresh rolls - they were really good, especially with the dipping sauce. It had a nice kick! \n\nI had the chicken and shrimp Pad Thai and my husband ventured into something new - the Gai Nei Lung. It looked like a stir fried chicken, vegetable, cashew combo that's served in a really cool fried egg noodle basket. Great presentation! We both thought it was a little bland, but next time we'll ask for it spicier. \n\nThey seem to do a lot of takeout orders and I noticed they are part of the Foodie Call service (I've never used it, need to check it out). If you're looking for a new Thai spot, check it out!\n\nP.S. here is the link to their menu: http://www.thaiorchidrestaurantcharlotte.com/exotic-cuisine-services
Until tonight, I have never understood my husband's obsession with Angel Wings. For all the years I've known him, virtually every time we've ordered Thai takeout (which was quite often in San Francisco) he's doggedly opted for these weird deep-fried chicken wings stuffed with all manner of whatnot, They've always seemed greasy, bland despite the long list of ingredients, an affront to the explosion of flavor that I associate with Thai food.\n\nTonight, however, when he took me to Thai Orchid in his old stomping grounds in Charlotte, I finally got it. These were made with a level of love not ever seen before in the fried Thai chicken department. The secret seems to be steaming your de-boned stuffed wings so they stay wonderfully moist, then bathing them in a buttermilk batter before you deep-fry them. Man, they were good.  \n\nFor my part, I played it safe but successfully with a chicken pad khing sod, which included ginger, mushroom, snow peas, green onions and napa cabbage. It was also very flavorful, just the right amount of ginger.\n\nMy main quibble with our dining experience was that they served us way too fast! It's not always a good thing to be sat, served and delivered your check in 47 minutes. This is not necessarily the place to come for a long, lingering dining experience. That said, the people were nice as could be and we'll back back whenever we're next in Charlotte.
I went with my wife last night for a quick dinner.  Prices are better than other thai spots around here, but not as low as this ex-new yorker is used to paying.  We sat out in the covered porch area, which was good because the inner section of the restaurant had a old, stale smell to it.  Otherwise the decor and ambience was fine - it is more of a place for older people, not trendy at all, which is fine by me.\n\nThe food was meh.  The spring rolls were plain but fine.  My wife loved both the Thai beer and her coco-milk soup, however my pad thai was cloying sweet, without the acidic notes of tamarind or lemon.  It wasnt bad at all, but nothing special at all.  \n\nThe service was fine, though the one waitress passed a few times to ask us if we wanted more beer even though our glasses were still over half-full.   It is hard to find in the shopping complex, not right on Providence Road as our GPS was telling us.\n\nIf I need a quick Thai fix in the area I might do it again, but otherwise probably not.
I was surprised that I'd not discovered this sooner. I've been here twice so far and both times have not been disappointed. I'd recommend that if you like it spicy, to tell them (I ordered a dish with two peppers beside it and it was not that spicy - we fixed that on the second visit). The thai iced tea was delicious, and the tofu cubes nice and crisp withe the vegetable dishes I ordered. Love this place.
I've eaten a lot of Thai food and cook a lot of Asian foods (I'm Asian) so I had very high expectations coming here for lunch. We ordered the lunch specials Pad Thai and Yellow Curry, along with a plate of chicken larb. The food came out hot and fresh and the waitresses were very nice but there was more to be desired with the food. \n\nThe larb came to the table warm and had mint leaves that was already turning black. Either the larb was old or the mint leaves used were not fresh. I've made and eaten enough larb to know that mint leaves don't turn black until at least the next day. \n\nThere was nothing overly special about the pad thai or yellow curry. Nothing in flavor that screamed \"Wow that was REALLY good.\" \n\nPlus: lunch came with a hot soup and hot crispy spring roll and both were really good!
4.5 Stars, rounded up to 5 because of their sublime Pad Thai!\n\nLet me cut to the chase, the Pad Thai here is the best I've had in Charlotte! PERFECT blend of Sweet Heat, fish sauce, spices and herbs. Very tasty and perfectly cooked noodles made this a delectable dish!\n\nAlso got their Beef Basil Stir Fry which was outstanding, and a Thai Omelet with a red tomato based sauce with chicken and veggies.\n\nThe little Thai waitress was adorable, friendly and attentive. I actually had my FIRST Thai red wine...and it was pretty good! Had NO idea what I was drinking but it sure was tasty!\n\nThis is a small restaurant but I came early before it got crowded. This place has been in business for at least 15 years and apparently it has survived in the very competitive food scene for a reason: Their food is EXCELLENT! And not too hard on the wallet either.\n\nHighly recommended!
Kismot, you are one of the most impressive restaurants I have been to in Edinburgh.  There are two parts to this story that show why I think this.\n\nFOOD:\nJust superb.  Easily the best Indian food that I have eaten thus far.  I was part of a large group of over 20, and we paid a fixed price each to get a large number of naans and bhajees, and a selection of different curries along with plentiful amounts of rice.  All of the curries were incredibly tasty, and most of them didn't last long at all on our table.\n\nKismot also provides some interesting dishes that I have not seen replicated anywhere else.  You can get chocolate naan (no, that's not a typo!), which sounds worth a go, although I haven;t tried it myself.  They also serve what they call the 'Kismot Killer', a stupidly hot curry that sounds more like torture than food.  If you can eat it all, you get it for free, though their website suggests, and I quote: \"It is recommended that you put your toilet roll in the freezer when you return home.\"  You actually have to sign a disclaimer before you eat it!\n\nSERVICE:\n\nThe restaurant is run by a family team, with the parents in the kitchen, and the eldest son commanding the front of house.  It goes without saying that the parents do a great job behind the scenes in the kitchen.  It is the front of house experience that puts the icing on the ca.....curry for me.  Throughout the meal, we were attended to in the ideal way - attentive, but not intrusive.  Orders were taken in a cheery manner, and he even joked with us as we sat and waited.  His manners were truly impeccable, and he saw us out of the restaurant personally at the end of the meal.  I have never before or since experienced better customer service.\n\nAs you can see, I LOVE this place.  You just have to go there.  Cancel tonight's dinner plans, and make a reservation at Kismot.  You will keep coming back for more!
Great family run Indian,authentic dishes,good portions and added bonus of BYOB!Reasonably priced and the home of the famous Kismot Killer...try if you dare!Great selection of twists on Indian classics,i.e. chocolate nan!Relaxed surroundings,great for groups and service was fun and friendly.
I am not sure why I haven't done a review of Kismot earlier as this is one of my favourite  restaurants in Edinburgh. I have been coming here for a number of years and I think this is due to the proximatey of the Auld hoose - alternative music, a couple of brews and then onto a curry. Cannot beat that of an evening for me. \n\nOnto the restaurant the decor has had a little bit of a face lift of late with some newly designed posters, as has the menu. Not going to go into too much detail as previous reviewers have mentioned this, but it is a good thing. One thing that stuck me is the new additions to the menu - Kismot Naga pickle and Iron Bruna, yep a curry with Irn Bru. \n\nThis is a family run restaurant and the sons greet you on the door with a bit of friendly banter. You can see the other family members beavering away in the kitchen when you first enter.  \n\nThe food here is always up to high standards and our last outing was no exception. We opted for the pickle trays, poppadoms, raitha and naga chilli pickle. all washed down with lots of Mango lassi. The starter was great but the naga chilli in particular was excellent, beware this comes with an 18 certificate warning and is very spicy. \n\nThe main courses were Veg Madras, Chicken Masalla, Prawn passanda and Chicken Tikka North Indian Chilli Garlic. All were great their Chilli Garlic is still my favourite version of this disk in Edinburgh. One thing to bear in mind you get lots of rice and the nans are large so unless you ha vent eaten all day a rice and nan portion does 3 easily. Either that or it was something to do with the fact we order another jug of lassi, but i don't think I ever come away as full eating any where else. \n\nThumbs up from me.\n\nFavourite dishes here:\n\n- Mums Desi Khani, homemade curry with limited availability. Worth a try if you are there at the weekend. \n- Mango lassi by the jug\n- Bhindi\n- North Indian Chilli Garlic\n- Any of the Madras dishes\n- Naga Chili pickle, beware very spicy\n- Methi \n- Raitha
Without a doubt one of the finest Indian restaurants in Edinburgh. The inviting and friendly atmosphere, of which the Ali family are very proud, immediately creates a pleasant eating environment. The food itself is excellent, combining the traditional dishes you would expect of any self-respecting curry house with a wide array of regional specialities. Particularly good is the North Indian Chilli Garlic, and as a man who doesn't like to have his palate destroyed by excessive spice, its strength (as with all the dishes) can be adjusted to your taste. And why not accompany your curry with the strange sounding but weirdly delicious chocolate nan bread\n\nAlthough alcohol is not served, there is the option of BYOB with the added advantage of no corkage. Kismot pride themselves on a fun atmosphere and as a result it is an ideal place to book large parties, with their group menus affordable and surprisingly varied.\n\nOverall then an excellent place, whether for a great group night out or if you want to try the infamous Kismot Killer, vying for the place of spiciest curry in Scotland.
This was the best and spiciest curry I found in Edinburgh.\n\nIt was also had the single best restaurant decor I have EVER seen. The place is literally family-run and they're some of the most hospitable and friendly people in the world.\n\nI went on a curry tour of Edinburgh while I was on holiday. I've eaten curry on three continents now and, back home, I like to get my Indian take-away and add both habaneros and ghost pepper hot sauce to it before I eat it. Curry, and especially spicy curry, is very much an essential part of my life. So I picked a new Indian joint each night while I was in the city in an attempt to find it.\n\nThe Kismot Killer wasn't available at the time I showed up but I was advised by my waiter (one of the coolest, most welcoming guys I've ever met) it's so spicy that it takes away from the actual FLAVOR of the curry, anyway. Let's be honest, there's a point when spicy becomes less about flavor and enjoyment than pure ego.\n\nSo I got the next spiciest curry on the menu - Vegetable Naga - and asked for IT extra spicy, with rice and chapati. The food was EXCELLENT. The dish, even without modification, was ACTUALLY a fair amount spicy - which, if I can taste a bit of spice, most people probably shouldn't eat it - and the flavors were SO vivid and pleasant. I would've preferred it spicier by a bit but that's okay, it was still the spiciest curry I was able to find in the city and definitely my favourite. \n\nNext time I go to Edinburgh I shall be visiting again.
I was looking for a nice restaurant in Edinburgh while I was in town for a short visit, and decided to give Kismot a try. The food was excellent, and more than sufficiently spicy. Portions were generous, and the staff was very friendly. I am very glad I decided to try this place out.\n\nOne bit of advice: I was lucky to get in without a reservation, as the place was quite busy. If you plan to go, phone ahead.
Went on a team night out to Kismot at Christmas and it was fantastic. The service, from the detail they went into at the booking stage (we were a group of 11) to the welcome we received on the night was authentic and real, and I immediately started recommending it to people even before I ate my first bite! We had a sharing menu, which was fabulous value for money. There was so much food we couldn't finish it. Extremely useful to know that it is byob and (at the time of writing) there is NO CORKAGE charge. Yes, no charge! How refreshing. This is a not-many-frills place, plain tables and decor, it's all about the food you see, so if you are happy with that before you go your expectations will be blown away and you will have a great night. It is efficient, clean and friendly, like all the best places in town. The chicken and mango curry was a hit as were the huge pakora that came out as starters. Absolutely lovely family fare. Have a great time when you go - this is some of the best curry in Edinburgh.
Others may be so inclined to usher you towards The Mosque Kitchen for some traditional food, but they'd be doing you a massive disservice. Kismot is absolutely one of the tastiest restaurants in Edinburgh. I've been a handful of times, and each time it has been stellar.\n\nA recent development that left me a bit underwhelmed was their menu redesign. The menu has been drastically cut and the star rating system has been scrapped. Now, you're left with merely three levels of heat, mild, medium and hot. I take heat relatively well and medium had me sweating in my seat. \n\nIn case you're wondering, they also offer the Kismot Killer challenge for \uffe120 (I think). It's a ridiculously hot dish that is 99% chilli seeds. Our friend from Bangalore was pressured into accepting the challenge, and he was less than thrilled to be eating it. After three big hulking bites he quit. \n\nThe staff here is stellar. They are super nice, talkative, accommodating and knowledgeable. If they take a liking you may even meet auntie in the back!\n\nThe only reason this place is receiving 4 stars and not 5 is the loudness. The place is very open and conversations echo quite a bit. Therefore... if a stag or hen party is there then you may as well assume you won't be hearing much else than their banter. \n\nThe place is BYOB!
My absolute favourite curry in Edinburgh! I always take friends here when they visit and it is consistently delicious! Favourites include the lamb Jalfrezi, saag aloo, pilau, garlic naan and peshwari naan. Although everything I have ever had was delicious. It's on the spicy side, which I love but might not be great for others. The staff are amazingly friendly but not overly pushy, it's a family business and you can watch mom and dad cooking in the kitchen through a window-it's just a great place, great food, great experience.
Had a couple of excellent meals here and plan on many more. The huge menu demands return visits! If you feel overwhelmed by the choice on offer the staff are happy to suggest dishes.\n\n\n It's unlicenced, but there is no corkage so pick up some booze from one of the off-licences on Nicholson Street.\n\n\n A tip though: it's a family-run place with a small kitchen staff, so go early, especially if you're a large party. The food is well worth the wait though!
I visited Kismot last summer with a group of my friends, a few of which wanted to try the Kismot Killer. Although there was a large table of us (around 12 people) the kitchen accomodated us well with all of the food arriving hot and fresh and on time. The two who ordered the Kismot were baited by the waiter, who had a wonderful sense of humour and engaged our table in witty banter the whole night.\nThe korma that I ordered was absolutely delicious, and I can't be too complimentary about the chocolate filled naan bread (mmm). All in all a wonderful night and I would recommend it to anyone.\nFor a longer review (with pics and quotes from my mates) check out my blog\nhttp://www.jemmaeatworld.com/2011/10/kismot-killer-indian-edinburgh-hottest-curry/
Went there last night with a group of friend, wonderful food and fab service
A visit to this place is a pleasant experience for more than its cuisine. Service is personal and the affable nature of Ali, the owner's son, is a USP of this place. He welcomes every guest and makes them feel special. Food is really good and I highly recommend Chicken Garam masala, Prawn poori, Methi Chicken and Saag paneer. You can take your own booze, so that's an advantage as well. The only dampners are repititive music (Really they must buy some new CDs) and garish interiors.
Easily the best traditional style curry house in Edinburgh, long since recommended but we'd never gotten around to a visit.\n\nWe loved it, the service was great and the knowledge of the food was second to none, able to tailor our flavours to the level of heat we wanted, and since I'm a softie and my wife loves the intense heat this was great.\n\nIt reminded me of the best Indian food I'd eaten as a student, but better.\n\nI cannot wait to go back.
This place sets the standard for a family run restuarant. it feels like your guests in their home.\n\nThe food is outstanding, choclate Nan was a bit sickening at first. But i found myself eating the whole thing. For a main I got the Lamb Biryani with some mushroom bhajee on side, everything was perfectly cooked (especially the bhajee, these guys are the only people in the city that do it right). It's all very cheap too!\n\nPlease visit!
go here! its amazing food! chana puri :) king prawn jahlfrezie :o and to cope with the burn, pistachio kulfi.oh my god! heaven on a plate wearing a turban..
Funky is the first word to come to mind. The place is all pinks and purples and turquoises and dark tables. Even the water jugs are purple or turquoise. There's a plasma screen showing a loop commercial for their King of Curry thing that they do, with their top media hits included. It's kind if distracting watching Jack Whitehall and James Corden crying and drinking bowls of yoghurt, but it kind of fits with the funky thing. If they took out the tables, chucked in a couple of lava lamps and cushions, and maybe tiled one wall with tiny mosaic mirrors, it'd be a cocktail bar nightclub.\n\nBut it's a restaurant. And it is good at being a restaurant. The food hit the spot perfectly; our vegetable pakora/onion bhajis were soft and crispy, while my chicken korma was rich, creamy, plentiful and contained great big hunks of birdy goodness. The peshwari naan don't quite reach the giddy heights of those served at Skipton Balti in Yorkshire (nothing ever will) but they're easily the closest I've had! Sweet and flavoury (still totally a word), they're lined with deliciousness.\n\nThe staff dealt with our considerable party size expertly, even shuffling tables in and out to match our miscounted numbers with not a rolled eye to be seen or a tut to be heard. I was surprised there was no water brought until we asked, well after the arrival of the poppadums at the start, but it was otherwise pretty flawless service too.\n\nIt's a bit outr\u00e9 for my tastes in terms of decor but it's damn fine food, y'all.
Everything about Kismot was excellent. Food was outstanding. Great family owned restaurant. You must try Mum's chicken and the massalan chocolate. Incredible and a first for me. I would come back in a heart beat. Staff was great with my young kids and, surprisingly, they enjoyed the good too. Make reservations as it is booked often, we were lucky to be seated without reservations from what we observed. Check it It out if you can.
I thought the food in here was brilliant. We went here for my friends birthday and the choice on the menu was brilliant. There was a rowdy table next to us who were tormenting the staff (to say the least) and they dealt with it well. The downside was that it took 1hr 15mins to get any food so make sure you are not famished when you arrive.\nWe ordered one of the new kismot killers for the table to share and it was bloody HOT!!!\nI am usually a jalfreizi person and my partner enjoys a vindaloo, but this is something else. I had one spoonful and felt the burn for about one hour afterwards!! The smell of the kismot killer is not good and you can see a fair amount of chilli seeds in there.\nBut it is all part of the fun!!\nWould go here again, definitely!
This may be the best Indian I have ever had.  I've had several curries on this long trip, but wow - this one wins the prize.  They are also BYOB, which is fairly common in the States at Asian and Indian restaurants, but perhaps not as much here?  So it was a very nice treat to bring loads of wine and beer for the group.  Dimly lit, casual atmosphere, and friendly service.  There were about ten of us in a group, but everything went really smoothly.\n\nStarted with some delicious chicken pakoras with a few different sauces, then followed it up with the chicken deshi khani and a side of the best, freshest sag alu I've ever had.  The deshi khani is advertised as being \"limited availability,\" and a special, particularly authentic curry.  Spicy, rich, and succulent, it was one of the best curries I've ever had.  And the sag alu!  Not the fatty (but delicious) creamy spinach you usually get at Indian restaurants, this was fresh and brimming with spice.  Would've been happy to get it as a main with paneer, but I didn't think to do so because I figured it would be pretty standard instead of spectacular, and I was wrong!\n\nMy friend ordered something they used to serve but is no longer printed on the menu and they still make it for her.  Fragrant pilau rice and hot, crispy garlic naan made this such an outstanding meal.  I'd beeline here the next time I was in Edinburgh because as far as I'm concerned, this is as good as Indian gets.
This is an excellent family run curry house. The staff are extremely friendly, watch out for the head waiter in his kilt. If you like mild curries, the korma, pasanda, honey and mango curries are all personal favourites. Would be a far more popular restaurant if it was in a better location.
We just returned from dinner at Kismot with mixed reviews. We ordered the family curry (literally the curry that the owner-family makes and eats itself), saag panir (spinach with cheese curry), vegetable samosas and two kinds of bread -- naan and garlic paratha. We were welcomed by a very genial host and were ready to love it. However, the samosas were teensy tiny little triangles in filo dough. The filo and two sauces that came with it totally overwhelmed the thimbleful of stuffing. We then waited  and waited and waited for our main courses and bread while people who arrived after us ordered and were served. Our order wasn't  odd or difficult so I'm not sure what the lag was. Usually filling time before dinner conversing with my companion is a joy but we'd had a challenging day and the wait was just too long. Finally the food arrived. The family chicken curry was delicious but I'm not sure it was what I'd actually ordered. The owner and 'warned' me that there was some unusual lemon/lime fruit in the curry that was typical of Bangladeshi food and you could only get it if you have a Bangladeshi friend or traveled there. I was feeling adventurous so I ordered it. The dish was really yummy but nary a Bangladeshi lemon in the whole thing. I asked the host about it and he said the lemon was in the sauce but, seriously, I know what lemon tastes like and it wasn't there. Whatevs. The naan bread was very good too. On the other hand, the saag panir  was seriously under-seasoned and just didn't have much flavor, very atypical of Indian food. The garlic paratha was good while hot but not palatable once it got cold. We were expecting to be wowed based on all the Yelp reviews but this one only gets 2 stars for the underseasoned food and the long long wait.
Beware the Kismot Killer - officially Britain's hottest curry. You will be asked to sign a disclaimer before stepping up to this challenge, and if you can eat the whole thing, you get your meal for free!\n\n\n But for those of us with a more sensitive palate and sensible disposition, there is an extremely wide selection of dishes to choose from. If you are feeling too spoilt for choice to choose, the staff are always ready with suggestions.\n\n\n Family-run businesses like Kismot are rare in these times, and you will appreciate the comfortable atmosphere and excellent food.
We made a special trip to Kismot because of how well reviewed it is, and it didn't disappoint. On our long walk there, we grabbed a few bottles of wine, and when we arrived we were seated immediately. The staff were constantly smiling as were the patrons. We ordered the garlic naan (huge), the aubergine, the sag paneer, the chicken tikka, a salad, and the pickle appetizer. The sides are each about 2 cups of food, and the chicken dish was about 3 cups. The salad was larger, composed primarily of iceberg lettuce - fine with us, we just wanted some raw vegetables. The chicken was delectably moist and the sauce was perfect. The naan came out warm and fresh. The only thing I wouldn't order again is the pickle app, which had two different kinds of pickle-based sauces (more like a tapanade), one of which was quite bitter, a delicious marmalade type spread, and something else I can't remember. It only cost 4 pounds or so, but we left most of it - being too pickle-y for us - but if you do really enjoy pickles you would probably really like it. Overall, I think our bill for two was around 35 pounds, which is completely reasonable for home cooked Indian food, served up by a local family business.
Friendly, efficient service was the icing in the cake of the best lamb saag I've ever eaten. BYOB policy, no corkage charge - what's not to like?
I can't believe I like Indian curry so much - NOW!\nWas I glad I went and met my fellow Yelpers at this tucked away place on St Leonard Street. The outside is painted lilac and you might think what is this all about, but it all fits the style they project. I guess its not a typical Indian restaurant you might visit from time to time, but rather something different. I found it very relaxing, clean, customer friendly, attentive, reasonable priced and somehow it reminds me of WINGS, the chicken wings extravaganza in old town.\n\nIts BYOB! Bring your own beer or wine!\n\nI ordered the medium version of Jahore curry sauce with lamb and Garlic and Coriander Nan bread. The lamb was soft and tender. The tomato sauce savory and a bit spicey. Am I glad I went for medium heat as the hot versions will make you twitch :-). One of my Yelper friends spit fire towards the end of the meal. The other was glad to have gotten a spare beer to mellow the burning sensation.\n\nThe menu choices are amazing and you can choose between mild, medium, sweet and sour and hot curry sauces. And if I say hot, its really HOT, but not as hot as the Killer Curry!!!!!!! Yep you heard right. Don't forget to read the small print! \nOther curries that stood out: mild chocolate curry and Iron Bru curry or try Mama's and Papas special curry on bones. Also try Nutella or Haggis or Marshmallow or chocolate nan bread :-)\n\nThe personel was really friendly and very, very attentive. The interior is classy and trendy.\n\nDon't miss out on a fantastic curry experience!
The food was just ok and kind of bland.  We have enjoyed Indian food around the globe and neither the food nor the service impressed.  It was Ramadan so maybe that had an effect, but after all the great reviews, we were disappointed.
As someone who's not usually a fan of indian restaurants, I have to say i love this place.\n\nRun by two generations of the extremely welcoming Ali family, Kismot offers all the usual dishes you'd expect to find in on the menu in an indian restaurant, but what sets this place apart are the things you certainly wouldn't expect to see.\n\nThe chocolate naan bread, although it may sound strange, goes extremely well with the spiciness of a curry disha dn is definitely worth trying.\n\nWhat i wouldn't recommend to anyone but the bravest is the \"spiciest curry in Scotland\" according to the menu and all the staff. I wasn't plucky enough to give it a go myself, but i having spoken to people that have, I'd say it's definitely not for the faint-hearted!\n\nIn contrast to so many family-run local restaurants, the d\u00e9cor in Kismot is upmarket, clean and elegant. This, combined with the unique atmosphere and great choice of dishes to choose from, is what I think makes it such a success.\n\nFor curry and rice/naan for two people you can expect to pay \uffe125, and there is also the option of BYOB.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit, especially if you're looking for somewhere to cater for large groups.
Not only was this the best Indian food I've ever had, it was also some of the best service I've received in any restaurant. I could not recommend this restaurant more. If you're in Edinburgh and you enjoy amazing food served by a talented and incredibly friendly family then this is a restaurant that you must try.
We visited Edinburgh, Scotland during Spring Break and heard about this restaurant. The entire family was extraordinarily nice and welcoming. We ordered the Korma and Vindaloo. The pickel tray was amazing with all the breads. We also tried the okra and spinach side dishes and that were perfect. My 6-year old loved the Tandoori Chicken and chocolate milkshakes. We will definitely come back (all the way from Texas)!
Kismot opened a few years ago and has been very popular ever since. It offers delicious curries, all cooked by the head waiter's parents. He will endeavour to tell you about his parents cooking behind the scenes, giving this restaurant a personal touch. A great feature is that bringing your own alcohol for a meal is actually encouraged, this is because the familys religious beliefs prevent them from selling it to customers. A great place for an indian meal.
We visited due to the excellent reviews on trip advisor....We were not disappointed! Even our taxi driver had had it recommended countless times via word of mouth! \nService was excellent. Lamb was slow cooked to perfection & Naan bread was super! Theonly let down was that we had ordered from the meduium section and the curries were not at all hot. They were very good though. Thank you for a delicious meal! We will definitely recommend to our friends & be back next time were in Edinburgh. Great to see a family restaurant doing so well.
Thank you to the Yelp community for turning me and my family onto Kismot. We were not disappointed. What an incredible dining experience! \n\nI am visiting Edinburgh from NYC and I really wish I could take this restaurant home with me. It is a truly \"family run\" establishment. We were greeted by the sons of the husband and wife chefs who work together to make every homemade item on the menu. I wish I had written down all the dishes we had but I can tell you that no matter what you order you will devour every morsel. \n\nIn addition to the outstanding food (my entire family agreed: best Indian food we have EVER had... and we have had a LOT!), the service was top notch. Everything came out in a timely fashion which was so impressive since it was obviously homemade. We got a chance to meet the chef after the meal to praise him and tell him about his fabulous yelp reviews... and then promised to write another to make sure he maintains that 5 star rating he so deserves. \n\nTo anyone visiting Edinburgh... you MUST MUST visit Kismot. We will definitely be back before we depart. \n\nThank you Kismot for a superb experience.
The atmosphere and the service there are really good - with Indian music and passionate server. \n\nIt's a little different from other Indian restaurants in Edinburgh. You can firstly choose the main course and then choose the base you like. They have four different kinds of bases with different spice. Ask the waiter there for recommendation! Chicken and lamb suit different bases. I would recommend mild one though. \n\nThe amount of dishes there are quite large. I had to pack eventually.\n\nIt's a little bit expensive compared with other Indian restaurant, but it worth.\n\nSuitable for family/friends reunion.
We wanted to grab some Indian food after hiking Arthur's Seat, and this was the first spot we found on our walk back to old town Edinburgh. Man, did we luck out!\n\nThis was so far beyond my expectations. The Chicken Deshi Khani was out of this world, incredibly spicy but not incredibly hot, if that makes sense. Just wonderful. The lamb biriyani was also great, and garlic naan... very yuummmm.\n\nVery happy we had the serendipity to stumble on Kismot, it was fantastic!
Very friendly service with some secret recipe treats included to make the meal more interesting and fun. Good selection of curries, but get there early or book ahead. Plenty of vegetarian options too.
We did some intensive research on where to eat for our recent trip to Edinburgh and are so glad we stumbled on this true gem of a restaurant to experience.\n\nI'd checked out the menu and website so was really looking forward to the 'family run' and 'authentic' Kismot.\n\nEven from the initial call to reserve our table there was warm and friendly service and a cheeky chappie attitude!\n\nWe arrived in a taxi as the actual restaurant was situated outside of the City Centre where we stayed and even the taxi driver had heard great things about the place!\n\nWe were greeted like family and it was clear from how busy the place was that it's a favourite of a lot of people.\n\nWe'd considered taking beer as it's BYOB Establishment but decided to try sample the novelty of just the curry instead.\n\nThe staff were very buzzy, and we were seated in the corner by the window where we had ample opportunity for people watching and the to see into the kitchen which is a great experience in itself! (the mam and dad do the cooking and the boys/cousins/uncles do the waiting on!)\n\nWe had poppadoms to chow over while we considered the menu and with them the BEST pickle try ever- all were tasty, tangy and plentiful!\nWe ordered a starter to share and i just had to try Kismot Naga pickle- just to be able to say I'd tried it! (the Mr had a sweat on just thinking about it!)\n\nWell- it pained my insides so PLEASE take care should you feel brave enough to try it!!!!!!!! The small pot of it which was brought was sufficient to taste but not over indulge!\n\nThe starter of mixed tikka was HUGE! All the meat was of a good quality and the salad was a nice accompaniment.\n\nThe staff were very attentive and when we had a time to wait or a break between courses one of them always came over to check we were doing OK and just have general chit-chat! We honestly felt like very special friends.\n\nFor main course we had-\nLamb Ada- cooked with fresh ginger, tomatoes, lemon & methi leaves and strong Eastern Spices.\nChicken Zeera- roast cumin seeds, fresh herbs & coriander.\nGarlic Nan.\n\nAgain, the portions were HUGE, not really a complaint but the 'not so skinny brother'  might have taken a bit of offence that we were well and truly stuffed and seemed like we hadn't even made a dent in the food and had this not been the 1st of out 2 night stay we would have certainly taken the rest home!\n\nThe meat was great quality and the flavours just as described, definitely notes of food made with experience and love.\n\nThe bill was almost embarrassingly minimal for what we had enjoyed but it just shows you don't have to pay over the odds to get truly good food and great service!\n\nWe had a great time at this place and have recommended it to everyone who will listen for when they visit Edinburgh.\n\nWe hope to get back to it one day.
Kismot shuts for a family holiday in February, it closes for almost a whole month and this is one of the reasons for my increase in curry reviews... That month made me realise that while some other purveyors of curry are really good, I rate Kismot above them.\n\nThey also recently reworked the menu, dropping a few of the less popular specialities and streamlining it. It now separates the curries by spiciness, so depending on what you fancy you can focus on one part.\n\nAs the old adage goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder, Kismot has earned five stars from me, I keep coming back and it really is the best curry in Edinburgh.
Some of the best Indian food I've had anywhere. I'm from Chicago which has plentiful Indian restaurants and we were curious what Indian food in the UK would be like. Kismot was so delicious I wish it was in my neighborhood at home. If it were I'd be going once a week. The pickle platter was very interesting and the curries were perfect. The service (by the mom and pop who run the place) was warm and the prices reasonable.
I thought I wasn't in the mood for Indian food so we tried another place first but were turned away not, having booked. Our second choice turned out only to be a lunch place, now closed for the evening. A pub crowded with students did not appeal. We decided to try Kismot since it was next door to the noisy pub. Although without a reservation, we were seated immediately. Having only a hour before the concert we wished to attend, we ordered only one dish to share plus two kinds of naan. The garlic coriander naan arrived fairly quickly. It tasted only mildly of its toppings. The cheese naan arrived with our main dish and was really delicious. Finally the main dish arrived. It was a revelation: chocolate massallam. This was the most amazing thing I tasted during the ten days we spent in London and Edinburgh. It didn't taste exactly like chocolate, but had a rich flavor so unexpected and delicious that after Jeremy left to the concert, I stayed behind to finish every bit of it. One caveat: this does not come with rice. If desired, rice must be ordered separately.\n\nI told our server we'd be back every day to sample more of their menu but sadly, that was not to be. Returning to Kismot will be a top priority next time I'm in Edinburgh.
For my money this is the best curry house in Edinburgh and would not look out of place up against the better ones in my home town of Glasgow.\n\n\n You can taste the individual spices and the fresh herbs in their cooking. They even know how to do decent pakora which is a rarity on the east coast.\n\n\n The head waiter (who is the son of the family) was very friendly without being overbearing and was very accommodating when it came to requests for the strength of one of the curries to be toned down.\n\n\n BYOB is great and really makes this a good value night out. The home delivery service is just as good.
Kismot is a family run restaurant that has excellent food and service! They do not serve alcohol but have no problem with you bringing your own. They even remind you of this when making the booking. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the son and seated promptly. The decor is modern and the ambiance has a lively feel.\n\nWe tried a few different curries, tarka dhal, and the garlic naan. Everything was delicious and we were stuffed beyond belief. I cannot emphasize how great the service was here. They make you feel as if you were invited to eat at their home with mum and dad cooking. Wonderful place and a must try!
Just dined here last evening on a trip to Edinburgh. Read their #1 reviews on trip advisor and had to stop by for a bite. It definitely met all my expectations. Personalized service, home cooked authentic food. I always return home from a trip craving a meal from my own kitchen, tired of mass produced, restaurant food. The owners parents are the cooks, and the home cooking really shines through. I ordered the lamb rogannjosh with garlic naan. Lamb was fork tender, curry well seasoned and containing bits of fresh veggies chopped up, including sliced tomato. This curry was made with loving hands, not poured from a jar! Bravo! I have no doubt you'll enjoy your meal if you stop by! My only regret was that I couldn't taste all the unique curries offered, but I guess that's just a reason to go back ((tummy growls))
Always come here for wine, had never tried the food until recently. Had the braised pork strozapretti pasta, I enjoyed it and am looking forward to trying more of the menu. I'd say the food was a solid 3.5, but the service was outstanding! Our waitress was very kind and patient with us as we continued to mix up our wine choices. \nHow sad that patio season is over. That definitely added to our enjoyment, but it will not stop me from warming up with some wine in the winter here.\nPress made for a great evening!
Thought i would give press another shot and my experience was definitely better. Our server was very professional and prompt. The goat cheese dip was outstanding. We were all fighting for the last piece. My mother got some sort of pumpkin pasta and after giving it a try she had to keep fighting my fork away. I got a black bean sandwich. Wasn't anything outstanding. Kind of just tasted like only black beans. Maybe a slaw or corn relish would bump up the flavor. The salad it came with was delicious. Very refreshing. Happy hour wine prices were very reasonable. I'm glad I tried press out again.
Sooooo my friends were passing through CLE via 90, en route to Vermont from Illinois.  I got the phone call \"Be here in two hours.  Can you find a spot that is convenient to get to from 90?\"\n\nSo I picked.....Lolita.  Except it's a Friday night.  Holiday weekend. No reservations available.  We decided to wing it and shoot for a first come/first serve spot at the bar.  No luck there either.  \n\nNow what? I KNOW!  Let's go to this wine bar across the street instead.  And so we did.  And what a find it was!!! None of us had wine, though.  My friends are from IL and NYC, and they had never tried Great Lakes Christmas Beer before, so I insisted that they must!   \n\nWe started with the cheese and meat board.  It was the perfect size for four people and contained a very generous and well-thought selection of meats and cheeses.  The pickled radish and the cablanca were my favorite items on the plate. For my entree I had the Press Burger: Red dragon cheese, smoked tomato aioli, arugula, and sliced vidalia onion on a challah bun.  Mmmmm.......one of the better burgers I've had in awhile!  The only thing I would have done differently would have been to caramelize the onion, instead of serving it raw. (Don't get me wrong; I love onion.  But raw onions stay with me for days.) I also tasted my friend Holly's dish: Roasted Chicken Breast which consisted of sage and goat cheese risotto, roasted cauliflower, and mushroom madeira sauce.  Delectable.  The cauliflower had great flavor and the risotto simply melted in my mouth.  \n\nThe decor was beautiful.  Exposed brick walls.  I think there was an old-fashioned butter churn at the bottom of the stairs, leading to the bathroom.  The bathroom sinks looked like wine barrels.   It was a cozy night and it was lightly snowing.  The cozy atmosphere at Press was absolutely perfect.  We decided that Tremont reminds us very much of a neighborhood in Brooklyn called Greenpoint.  A large Polish influence, a bunch of really cute pubs, shops, and restaurants, and a great selection of food.  The homes even look similar.  If you are famliar with Brooklyn, there also appears to be a park in Tremont similar to McCarren park.  \n\nBottom line: I want to make this my new favorite spot. I have lived here since last spring and I don't have a \"favorite spot\" yet.  And I'd be hard-pressed not to pick Press!
Best peanut butter torte ever! It was just incredible. Came in with a group of friends for a night cap, but soon we all were eating desert. \nServer was awesome! Very happy girl! \nIn glancing at the food menu, the prices seemed high, yet the place is in a great area, great atmosphere, so you pay extra I guess. I'm going back!
Trendy on the corner of Literary and Professor. We just missed Brunch, but the menu looked incredible!\n\nDelighted with the Prussian burger topped with Cleveland sauerkraut, sliced kielbasa, and swiss cheese. Spicy peppers too! \n\nAn Italian sausage and pepercini bianco pizza ... Nicely prepared with perfect crust.\n\nLastly, a Vesper made with cucumber vodka was the perfect dessert!  Yes, they had a limited selections of desserts, but the Vesper was the best choice!\n\nIf you like alcohol, they have a very cool list of each type of alcohol, each wine and beer.  Craft cocktails and martinis as well.\n\nI really recommend this place if you want to people watch or catch some sun!
My wife and I came here for dinner/drinks with a large group for a meet up.  \nThe service was polite and prompt. The server was also very knowledgable about the wine and beer. \nMy wife ordered a burger and I asked if I could have one with chicken instead of beef even though this option wasn't listed on the menu. The chef kindly agreed and I'm very glad they did; the sandwich was fantastic.  Very well seasoned, juicy, and the toppings and fries were also delicious. \nThe only thing not loved was the cocktail my wife ordered.
This place is bumping already!\n\nWe had a few \"new restaurant\" kinks - our dessert came out before our appetizers and service was a bit slow. But man, everything was very tasty.  I had the fried risotto, which I'm pretty sure was trying to kill me, and it was filled with cheesy delicious risotto and had a crispy fried outside.  \n\nThe wine list is very nice and features a few by-the-tap selections (pretty cool!) and lots of glass options.  The interior is a huge improvement from Lago's cheesy mural.  The wine room looks classy and very modern.  All the beer choices were from different Ohio breweries.  We weren't impressed with the cocktails, but at least that option is there for the non-wine person in the group.\n\nOverall, very nice and I hope they keep getting better.
I just don't think the food here is very good. If you just want a drink then come here. But, some friends and I have gone here twice and had food that wasn't worth the price. I got the braised lamb shank risotto last time thinking I couldn't go wrong but I didn't even care to finish it. And the amount of lamb in it was pretty small.
My friends and I found this place when we were wandering around the corner. I liked the Decoy 2011 wine we ordered - very tame but has a dry after taste. We also ordered the chocolate peanut butter mousse - it does not have that much chocolate cake or chocolate flavor, mainly dominated by its peanut butter mousse, but it's very soft and moist. I loved it. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Service was great too. You can definitely take your time to enjoy your wine.
Just popping in to update my last view. We just used Press to have my graduation party (50 people) and they knocked it out of the  park. Front of the house was perfect. Our open was at 4:00 and by 3:45 the space was 100% ready  to go. The front of the house manager and two servers were a head of the game and  gave the impression that this was not their first rodeo.  Through out the three hour event I never had a problem with drinks, service or bussing. Back of the house kept our taco bar fresh and our flat bread bar in perfect rotation.  If you are reading this review contemplating having a large event, listen up. This restaurant is where you should send your business. If you want a turn key event with no surprises this is your bet on Professor Avenue. Our contact was Sean, I believe he is the GM.
BRUNCH! Stopped at Press with girlfriends over the summer. Loved the experience. The food as fresh and the menu had many different items to choose from. I got the vegetable skillet and it was amazing. Potatoes on the bottom, eggs on top, mixed with fresh veggies and sprinkled with melted cheese on top. We of course could not pass up the Mimosa Kit. $35 for a bottle of champagne, 4 different juices and fresh fruit!
You know, it's funny--I've heard more about the brunch here than anything else. So that's what I came for and it was, in fact, a great spot for brunch. \n\nHowever, what about the fact that Press is indeed a wine bar? I really don't hear much about their non-brunch offerings, which I fear will hurt this place. But enough with that--let's focus on my brunch for a minute. \n\nThe drink menu for brunch is 5 stars, easy. Mmmmyes, passion fruit mimosa. But seriously, there are like almost 10 different mimosa options, plus there's a cart you can order for $35 that lets you \"decorate your own.\" The only bad side to it is that you get only one bottle of bubbly. In the mood for a savory cocktail? Their bloody mary offerings are badass. My guy ordered one that had a deviled egg and bacon in it. My sis got one with a stuffed pepper. My sister's bf said the coffee was pretty darn good, but I was too busy guzzling my mimosa. \n\nThe food is about a 3.5 for me. They offer up a lot unique brunch choices, but almost every option had 1-2 ingredients that I didn't like. What I really wanted was a traditional  brunch, so what I ordered was their shroom omelet (the closest thing to it.) What came out was a very plain looking omelet with wheat toast. Boy was I mistaken about the eggs--although simply prepared, the dish was eggcellent! HA! Seriously though, fluffy eggs, melty provolone, peppery arugula (I know... I'm over it too, but it was delicious) and the best mushrooms I've had in a long, long time. The wheat toast was darn good, too, although I like mine a little bit toastier. I could have done without the cold potatoes, which needed to be crispier.\n\nI think the prices could come down a dollar or two, but overall, a great brunch!
Went here for a social event so I don't know how credible this review will be...wine menu is decent.  Nice selection of domestics and internationals.  Food (cheese and meat board, flatbreads) was very tasty.  Service was good.  I have heard the brunch is great so I'll definitely go back.
NOT-im-PRESS-ed.        Where should I start?!? Half alive hostess....didn't know to seat us even though we stood at her \"stand\" for ten minutes. Food.... I wasnt sure what to even order. Finally got margarita pizza which literally (not being a drama queen or exaggerating) tasted like NOTHING. Server  didn't understand the wine list and also maybe saw us maybe two times.  Got the fried brussels...I would say (with agreement from co- eaters) taste like flaky overly buttered movie theater popcorn kernels. I don't know what to say. Would give them another chance, but shit, I don't know when.
Regarding brunch\n\nBrunch hours: Sat & Sun 1000-1500\n\nWe arrived at around 11 on Saturday. There was one table just leaving which left me as the only party in the restaurant. While we were eating 3 other parties came in, but the place was no where near full.\n\nService, as expected with the empty restaurant, was efficient and our waitress was on top of things. The kitchen was also quick. \n\nI ordered the Chorizo Skillet which was served in a skillet on a circular wooden trivet. It contained, Scrambled eggs, potato hash, local Chorizo sausage, roasted peppers, and a little cheddar cheese on top. It was all mixed together, but pretty much just layered, with the eggs on top, and potatoes on the bottom. It was really good in terms of flavour and the serving size was great, but it wasn't super hot. For being just made I thought it should have been hotter. It wasn't cold, but cool for having been a skillet. $10.50\n\nThe person I was with got the Crab Benedict which is a very cool idea. It is your normal eggs Benedict but between the egg and the Toasted English muffin is a seared crab cake. It is served with sriracha hollandaise sauce which can be obtained on the side. Well, she asked for the cook to go easy on the sauce, and the waitress' response was that she'd put it on the side... $12.50\n\nAll in all a good brunch, just oddly not busy. Perhaps it had more to do with the horribly plowed streets, which is where you have to park, more than the food.
The back room is an excellent place to host an event. The management and the staff was super flexible and nice. The food was outstanding as well!
A long overdue review........ my brother and sis in law brought us here for a tasting dinner.  Chef Matt's dad and my brother went to school together.  I am a total food person.  I am a professional cook and live for dining out and experiencing good food anywhere I go.  This dinner was one of my top five dinners of all time.  If you want a true treat, let Chef Matt cook for you.  Just let him cook.  Although much of what we had was on the menu, I can tell you that anything that comes out of his kitchen is going to be delicious.
Perfect Brunch.  Open Saturday and Sunday serving brunch til 3.  Good option if you don't want to stand outside waiting for a table at Lucky's or Grumpy's.  They have a bunch of different and very interesting Bloody Mary options, as well as Mimosa's.  They provide an entire 'Mimosa Cart' with about a dozen different berries/fruits as well as the same amount of different juices to add to your morning cocktail.  Friendly, good service and awesome atmosphere.  The food options for brunch are a bit limited and 'exotic', won't get your ordinary omelette or eggs benny here.  It's all got a twist to it.  I was more impressed with the Bloody Mary than the food, but that's enough for me.  Plus, each different variety of the drink comes with an 'appetizer'; mine with a cream cheese and bacon stuffed pepperoncini, and my friend's with peppered bacon and a deviled egg.  \n\nI'll definitely be back for brunch, and probably to try that barrel aged wine too.
Fried cheese curds were great. The brat was \"So, So\". The atmosphere was cool and I suggest you eat outside if the weather is nice.  Bartender was ditzy but other than that it was cool.
Burger was ok.  Ordering was confusing.  Sat at a table for a little while until we saw other customers get up from their tables and order.  The locals knew to do this.  Waffle fries ok. Chicken sandwich ok.  Outdoor seating was really the only highlight.
The owner of State St Brats is racist and has no business doing business in Madison Wisconsin!! To discriminate someone based off the way they look is overt racism!! Madison has long sense been a city of peace and love and equality and we don't need this restaurant destroying our community and our moral values!! I called in asking about Mark Zuckerberg and he was rude to me and was damn near interrogating me he never gave me his name but he was quick to hang up on me and kept saying \"WHAT DO YOU WANT!!!\" Someone who runs a business like that does not deserve one cent of my money!!! Please avoid State St Brats at all cost!!
So this place was recommended from the university tours guides. Was hoping great local place. \nFirst we day outside and literally had to wait about 15 minutes and ask twice to place our order. \nThe waitress never cleaned our table off and after finally getting their \"famous\" brats we had to get our own napkins, etc. I was hoping maybe the food would make up for bad service but it did not. \nThis is a dive bar at best. And drink/eat inside so you can place orders directly at bar.
Don't go here unless you are 21 and under! (Or, don't care how food tastes.)\n\nMy husband and I were very hungry one night and this was one of the only places open on State Street.  The plastic cows outside looked pretty inviting, so we thought why not?\n\nThe food is gross.  Even though it's a sit down restaurant, the food is on par with a fast food joint like Wendy's or Culver's (but of course, way more expensive to pay for the ambiance of 3,000 TVs adorning the walls).  Also note: they change their menu for late night (which I think is after 9p), making the selection a lot smaller (so don't go expecting anything more than chicken tenders or a burger made by the bartender).\n\nIf you just want to hit this place up for a beer and/or catch a game on one of the flat screens, I think this place would do.  Of course, I can imagine it being super packed when UW plays and I am too old for large numbers of people crammed into a tiny space :)
Nice place to get a brat in downtown Madison.  They offer traditional and red (spicy) brats, both are good.  The cheese curds are great and they are served with a side of ranch and a side of thousand island.  Grab a table on the patio when the weather is nice.
I am giving five stars to help out weigh the lowers. This is a four star bar and brat place. Great food and selection of beer. If you wanna hang out, drink, and watch sports, come here.
I agree with Stacy L. Terrible service. Went for lunch before the basketball game because it's close to Kohl Center.  Some customers got wait staff, some had to wait at the bar to order. No logical way they take or fill orders. Food was just so-so. Should have done what our 2 vegetarians did - walked over to Potbelly & brought food back here to watch the game while they ate. At least I saved money by not tipping & we got to the game early because we couldn't stand the place. Hey guys, you can't run a bar without staff!!
In town for business trip as my  home office is located in Madison. With a small group of co-workers and decided to go downtown. \n\nWe walked the main street going toward campus.  Once we reached the end, turned back and came across this bar.  It was either this or 5 Guys Burgers. Given my poor experience with 5 Guys in Phoenis, I opted for this location.  Besides, brauts in Wisconsin??? You have to give it a try. \n\nI had the Burger/Braut.  Pretty much a plain burger with a braut cut in half on top.  Others had the Hot Braut and one of the salads. \n\nIn general, food was just a little less than average. I can cook brauts better on my own grill using brauts from a better local pork shop. \n\nThe atmosphere is a different story.  First understand that we were there at 7 p.m. on a Monday night when college is pretty much out.  But this place had a nice set up of T.V.'s, and tables.  This location would make a great place to sit and watch a game. And I can only imagine what it would be like on a Saturday before/during/after a local college football game. \n\nAlso had the chance to try two local brews.  Had the Glauser (sp?).  Nice local brew.  There were several other options of beer and full bar. \n\nIf I ever get back to this place, will have to try it on a Friday or Saturday night.  \n\nBut if you are looking for something good to eat, well, keep walking!!!
Danced on stage. Bouncer told me to leave.  Was complying, and he slammed my arm in a door. Great service!
This is a great place to watch a football game in a rowdy, loud and fun environment. It's an epic college sports bar with a legacy I'm sure. \nThat being said, I expected cheese curd glory to happen here and it didn't. I guess my standard are a little higher no longer being in college and having a more refined palate when it comes to beer, food and libations. State street has a lot to offer I guess I just need to continue on until I find the right fit.
Stopped by for a quick sandwich and beer before the Badger game last night. Ordered the steak sandwich, which came on a hot dog bun. Really? Server did not ask how I wanted the steak done or if I wanted anything on it, either. The fries were good, but the server didn't present or offer to get any condiments. We had to go find them. New Glarus beers were on special Wednesday nights, which is great. I won't go out of my way to go here again. Back to the Big Ten Pub for me for game day.
Everytime I'm in town I hit this place for curds, beer and brats. I spent a whole Sunday watching football here and had a blast. Crowded times are a little annoying, but it is a college place. Love the mustard selections too. Curds are a must!
Really awful customer service. We asked two members of the staff to change the channel from the nightly news to a college football game and they were too lazy to do it. It was a Saturday night and everyone wanted to watch the game. The staff is not worried about taking care of their customers.
I think State Street Brats is a pretty decent place to enjoy some brats and cheese curds downtown. While their cheese curds don't quite compare to some other establishments around town, they'll definitely suffice. I love the selection in brats and burgers that are available and try to select a new item each time I go. Never have been disappointed yet!! Perhaps the Yelp deal aided in my great review but where else can you feed two adults for 10.98 anymore??
I attended a private party on the second floor and they had the A/C up all the way. It was freezing. I told a staff member but he said he couldn't do anything about it. Also, they served our group hamburgers but didn't offer hamburger toppings like lettuce, tomatoes or cheese.
I liked this bar a lot. Anywhere that has cheese curds & corn dogs for cheap is a win-win for me. Lots of places to sit, good music all night & a fun crowd. Great service as well.  I wish the weather would have been nicer because it looks like they have a great patio.
State St Brats was a recommended go to place for Brats, cheese curd, and brew on my visit to Madison. \nFirst the good... Our Brats & cheese curd was fine... Having a fully stocked self service condiment bar was nice... Good local brews and a friendly atmosphere. \n\nHey! State St Management how do you expect one person to wait on the entire bar area? Yea it's cool she has an IPad to take our orders but.... Let's see... we ordered Apps and Brats... And they all came out together... We had no silverware and when I asked for some we got 1 set for two people.. Our empty App baskets and our, subsequent, empty dinner baskets remained on our table until we left.... It was obvious that our server was just overwhelmed and service really suffered.. Would I go back on my next visit nah.....
What used to be a Madison tradition for college students and those looking for a fun gameday place has become an atrocious dump.\n\nI went there last Sunday with my wife to watch some football on their big screens upstairs, and boy did it not take long to make us leave.  For starters, we went to the bar upstairs to order some drinks and food, only to have the bartender be fairly rude and gruff when we asked questions.  He looked like a normal college-aged guy, but apparently he must have been hungover or something because he just didn't want to provide any kind of service what so ever.\n\nAfter paying for the food, my wife went back up to ask if they put a charge hold on the card because she remembered this from her time at college there, and it turned out they did.  I had no idea about this, and the bartender never mentioned it before I paid.  So it turns out, they put a charge on your card for FIFTY DOLLARS if you pay for anything with it.  The reason is to \"make sure you have money in your account\".  It's now four days later, and that charge is still sitting on my bank account, tying up money I could have used for other things.\n\nDuring this whole process, I was obviously a bit upset but I was calm about it because we wanted to just watch the games and have a good time.  Sadly, the volume on their speakers was set for Rave level, and I was going deaf from the noise level rather than being able to have a conversation and watch the game.  There were literally five people in the place, so I don't understand what they were gearing up for.  One of the big TVs was on ESPN while the other one was on the game, so I went up and asked if they could change it to one of the other football games that was on.  The bartender said it's going to happen (again gruffly), and eventually changed it to a game.\n\nWe finally got our food.  What used to be some of the best Madison Cheese Curds are now some over processed orange heap of nuked badness.  My burger looked like it had come out of a turnstyle vending machine.  Neither of the items tasted any better.\n\nGot up and left at this point, won't be back again unless I'm really really really drunk.  Which, granted, is probably the only time it's worth patronizing this pile of an establishment.
A staple on state street. White brat, red brat and cheese curds all very good. Fun atmosphere to chill and have some drinks.
Came on a Thursday night and was disappointed in the bar.  I had heard so many good things about this place, and it did look much fuller on Friday night and Saturday during the day, when the Badgers were playing.  Unfortunately, I only experienced the Thursday night experience and can only rate it as such.\n\nIt was kind of surprisingly lonely and empty here, and we didn't stay for a drink.  Well, we might have, but no one came and took our order.  At least there are lots of TVs for the games, etc.  With the word brats in the name though, I suppose next time I should try some of the food.
what you would expect to find.  Fries were not greasy.  Sausages were typical.  Local beers available.
Came here around midnight-ish on a Friday night because as a Purdue student I wanted to hit up some UW Madison college bars. \n\nThis place was nice- good crowd, good service, good music, and good specials. No complaints.\n\nI liked the indoor and outdoor seating arrangements with the dance area upstairs. \n\nI'd come back during the day to try the restaurant food here as well.
You don't go here for the food, you go for the huge amount of televisions and variety in drinks.\n\nThis is one of the few bars where my boyfriend, who can't eat gluten or wheat, can get an awesome bottled beer (Bard's Tale, a sorgum stout).  You can also find a wide variety of taps, liquors and they have many specials.\n\nLots of good places to sit, this is where I would go for big games, like the superbowl or FIFA world cup.  However, the food isn't great.  HOWEVER, compared to other places with bar food and such, it's a very good price.  At buffalo wild wings, the wings are much better but almost twice the price.  You get ten wings at state street brats for $6, which isn't bad.  Burgers are okay, probably the best thing on the menu are the cheese curds or waffle fries (but they're not called waffle fries).\n\nAnyways, don't come real hungry. :)
What are you doing sitting at home reading this when you could be at this place having a brat basket?  Get over yourself and go have a brat.  Good Lord, you're in Wisconsin just do it.
I was here a couple of years ago, and it was pretty good. However, I just returned...and was sorry that I did. The service was poor, the waffle fries were old/cold, and the brats were very dry. It really is my fault though, I still decided to visit this place even though I knew the ratings and reviews were poor on Yelp. No way I'd return.
Food was terrible, even their specialty, Brats!\nFries were awful, cheese curds were tasteless.
College is definitely getting back into town because the pubs are getting much more lively.  I couldn't pass up the cheese curds and they didn't disappoint. The atmosphere was fun and exactly what I was looking for tonight.
Good brats and cheese curds at this no frills bar and grill.  We tried both types of brats and they were both good, but the cheese curds stole the show.   A nice selection of beers on tap and a great beer garden to enjoy nice weather.  Friendly staff.
This brought me back to my college days, even waited in line to get in! We just came for a drink so I grabbed a spotted cow, took in the scene, and had a great night of it. It wasn't overly packed but a good amount of people, everyone having fun and being social. That's what it's all about, right? ;)
This is not the place to wander into at 9pm because you haven't eaten dinner yet and the Old Fashioned was too full. Thought we'd get some brats and curds. Two whites with mustard and kraut? Too bad, the condiment bar has been taken away and the kitchen won't dress our dogs... Okay, two Moon Man pale ales and an order of cheese curds. The beer was delicious, but the curds hadn't seen the inside of a fryer for the better part of 30 minutes, and were served with the saddest raw broccoli and carrots I've seen, along with a side of blue cheese dressing that had been sitting under the heat lamp... bleah! Keep the veggies away from the curds, for everyone's sake. I'll give them one more chance during a more food-friendly time!
I feel hungover and the guilt of being underage just by walking by this place.  Unless I'm super drunk to begin with, I'm probably not venturing in.\n\nOn another note, I gave this a second star because I hear they have (or used to have) a stock market pricing system where drinks cost more or less based on demand.  It's the only way I've ever really understood the economy, and that combined with the fact that they serve alcohol, merits two proud stars.
When I think of State Street, this is the place that comes to mind. Never had a bad time here. However (there is always a however), there should be televisions outside for watching whatever games are on. Also, there should be at least a beer \"person\" outside to avoid the lines inside (if that's legal). Free popcorn is always nice, but there should be one also on the second floor.
State Street Brats definitely is a case of taking the good with the bad. At its best, it can be great; at its worst, it can be really bad.\n\nFirst of all, one of my favorite lunches in Madison is grabbing a burger or a white brat with waffle fries. Their burgers are substantial and juicy. They and the white brats are served on fairly airy and light buns (which I prefer), and their condiment bar has just about any topping you can think of to adorn your sandwich.\n\nA1? Barbecue sauce? Hot sauce? Every manner of spicy mustard? No problem! Load up and turn that burger into a beef salad!\n\nOn the drink side of things, go for the Rose Bowl, which is an amorphous cherry-berry flavored concoction that'll have you flat on your face after a few of them if you are not careful.\n\nThe only cons are that it can be murderously crowded before and after Badger games or during prime night life hours. The other is that fisticuffs sometimes break out. My sister was brutally assaulted in the women's bathroom here. Ultimately that is more of a City of Madison PD problem than a Brats problem, as the staff handled the incident better than the cops did.\n\nOverall, I've had some great times here, including winning a Wisconsin shaped Point Beer raft in a raffle when partaking of cheap pitchers of beer on a Wednesday night. We blew it up while walking down the street to our next destination.
Great double bratwurst. Excellent meat, not dried out but juicy with a crispy skin. Spicy waffle fries were nothing special. Seems like an awesome hangout place, especially on gamedays.
State street brats has a dress code that openly discriminates against marginalized communities in Madison. When this was brought to light on social media, outraged patrons began to write reviews expressing their anger and feelings. As their ratings dropped, Brats responded by removing their ratings and reviews from their Facebook page. This establishment is no good and will not address the concerns of the community. This is a racist establishment an no one should give them their business.
Stopped in for the first time today. We ordered the cheese curds. Cheese was good would of been a better fried cheese curd if it was beer battered. My husband ordered the Worlds Best Brat and he thought it was good. I thought the bun was a little dry but otherwise it was good. I ordered the Pretzel burger with shoestring fries. Burger was done as I requested (med well). Burger was juicy and tasted like a burger right off my backyard grill. Yummy! Will be going back when I need a great burger during the winter. Staff was great and super friendly.
2 and 4 stars. There's no value in them. If a place is a four that means it's better than most, but there are specifically designated spots that are better. I'm not taking home silver, ok? But if a place is a two that means it's moderately bad. It's obviously not good. It's probably actively bad. But the 2 star gives it a special designation that neither 3 nor 1 stars gives it. There are better basic bars. This is boring.\n\nTo be honest, I'd rather come to this bar than other bro college bars. To be honest, I'd much rather go to some other bro college bars than this bar. It's just middle of the road bro-ey and college-ey. Sometimes friends or family or pretty girls will want to go here, and you know, that'll sway me more than any dumb opinion I've ever formed. But I don't want my memories of Madison to be, \"I won a bunch of cheap drinks at flip night and that's how I met your mom.\"\n\nYou all have a friend who has done that. Maybe two of them. They might be in love. Think about how nice those friends are. I'm sure they're really, really nice.\n\nThis may seem like an indictment of all college bars in Madison, and maybe it is. To be honest, I haven't stepped foot in this spot for years, so I don't even really know. But if you feel so compelled to read a review of this historic institution, I do have a few questions do pose to you. Where do the musicians hang out? The grad students? The aspiring politicians or theater kids? The kids that rap or throw paint on walls? I don't mean where do you see them, because of course you'll see them here. They're all pretty much bullied to come here, and they don't like any other spot in this city enough to complain that this place is not as cool.
I mean, I guess it's sort of a Madison Institution, right?\n\nBrats are basic, no-frills, and mediocre at best. You're much better going to another place that serves quality, local cuisine. Cheese curds are on par with Culver's...which is saying something (and not a good something, I might add). Fries are curly and pretty tasty.\n\nBeer is pretty pricey for a Madison dive. \n\nService is always excellent, bartenders nice. Cool outdoor patio. Food quality and prices makes this a 2 star joint, but it's important to note the service--which is, as said before, always great.
5 stars to watch sports, 4 stars to eat and hang, and 3 stars as a straight up bar.   I loved watching sports here on the big screens or grabbing  a burger or brat for dinner. \n\nIt kind of loses its appeal for me when it turns into a straight up bar on the weekend nights. However, its a great looking building that is coated in Badger red. This is the sports bar in Madison.  For me if a big game is to be  watched on TV, this is the number 1 atmosphere in town.
As long as I have traveled to Madison, I have made a point to stop down and eat a bratwurst (or two) at State Street Brats.  Wisconsin has a strong German heritage, and it's only appropriate that one of the best brats can be found a mile from the State Capitol.  It's a great place to start an evening of drinking on State Street.\n\nYou have a few choices of brats, red or white, and I suggest you add the waffle fries or cheese curds as a compliment.  The cheese curds are great by themselves too...yum! The waitstaff seemed non-existent, so we ordered from the bar.  The food was ready in about 10 minutes...prices, very reasonable.  They have a great assortment of toppings...a handful of mustard, sauerkraut, and even mayo for the fries in a bar toward the center of the downstairs eating area.\n\nAfter eating a few brats and drinking some brews, head out and turn right to head toward some other bars...but make your way back here later on, since they open a dance floor upstairs...with a bar in one corner serving PBR taps for cheap.  \n\nState Street Brats, it's quintessential Wisconsin.  It'd be fun to see what this place looks like on a Packer or Badger game day.
Delicious!! Brauts were cooked well and tasted great!  When I first sat down, I was a bit confused on how to order, but eventually figured out that you have to order from the front counter.  The setting was neat tho! All sorts of Badger gear around, so close to campus and downtown.  I would go back.
Yummy, yummy cheap red or white brats... Takes a while to cook on the grill as they didn't have any already grilling when I went. They didn't charge me for soda either. My companion says the beer is pretty tasty too...\n\nGreat, friendly service by the bar staff.
After seeing the  incredibly racist dress code, I will not be returning here. I will be encouraging friends and family to do the same.
Stopping through Madison...It's a solid establishment. Free popcorn, cheap food, decent service. Nothing spectacular.
The red brat + waffle fries is the way to go! Definitely a great setting to watch a UW game and also a great place to dance when out on the weekends!
I was looking forward to splurge with a brat and cheese curds. What I got was a big disappointment. Thr brat and curds were cold-cold curds=gross. The sauerkraut was limp and tasteless.  Even my soda was flat!  Maybe you have to be drunk to enjoy the food here. Sure miss the Brathaus!
A clearly racist dress code policy has barred one of my friends from entry, simply for wearing a cultural garment from Ghana. This \"rule\" of theirs discriminates against African American and other \"non-white\" dress. This has been going on for awhile, and management has done nothing about it. Absolutely disgusting. Will NOT be stopping here ever again. Nor will any friends of mine. I hope this ruins your company. I attached a picture of their posted dress code.
Sad to have a place like this on campus in Madison. Racist protocols, and rude management.
Blah, not so good. My mom was in town and we were looking for somewhere to eat on State St. Wanted to find a place with cheese curds. We stumbled across State St. Brats and it was ok.\n\nCheese curds were less than stellar. The brats were ok. I do like the toppings bar, but that was probably the highlight of the meal.\n\nThe outdoor seating area is cool, especially with the cows!
Amazing! The food was so quick, amazing burger and the cheese fries were so good. I got a bacon cheese burger and you could smell the grill! The cheese fries were done well and perfect cheese to fry ratio. The bun was toasty and a great atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone! Also reasonable prices food for the great service and the quality!
Dang, I really wanted to like State Street Brats. The location is great, and it's an awesome place to sit for a while just to take in the scene. The staff is nice and the bar is full, but the food is definitely underwhelming. \n\nMy brat was burnt to a crisp and my fries tasted as if they had been set out all day (they weren't even slightly warm). The boneless \"wings\" were frozen Tyson chicken nuggets reheated. Good bar and decent prices, but eat before you come.
We went for lunch and had great bratwurst sandwiches. The beer selection looked good too, but couldn't try since we all had to go back to work. Looks like a great sports bar, the bratwurst was better than some German restaurants, and service was friendly and quick. As a lunch place or pub, four stars, but probably only three if you don't like brats. Don't know how it would be as a sports bar--crowded, fun and full of students probably.
You gotta sit down stairs, order from the bar, and enjoy! Get a Sconnie beer and some brats! (Red or white, both good!)
Today is April 25th 2017 and there is a truly racist notification on the door of State Street brats which targets a specific race. Jesus! This is 2017! I posted the picture for you to view.
Congratulations, State Street Brats: you nailed it! And by \"it\" I mean being just awful. Last night some friends and I went to Brats after not being able to acquire hockey tickets. We wanted a semi-ridiculous, sports-centric atmosphere, so Brats seemed like the logical choice. We'd all been in college, and thought we knew what to expect. Nope.\n\nAfter grabbing a booth upstairs and sitting around for awhile, a waitress came by and asked if we were interested in ordering. After telling her yes, she told us that they were cutting their wait staff so we had to go to the bar to order. Not a huge deal, but there were some flaws:\n1) the wait staff that was supposedly cut were aimlessly wandering around the bar for the entire time we were there\n2) when you ordered, they told you to just come back and check if your food was ready - no estimate of time, no notification system, and again, no use of their employees milling about\n3) after our table had ordered and checked for food a few times, the table behind us got waiter service\nThanks for your outstanding customer service, guys!\n\nTo top it off, the food was as lacking as the service. The nachos were basically a pile of oil, the cheese curds eerily resembled bad breaded chicken used at fast food Chinese restaurants, and the burger baskets were a ripoff. While the burger was okay, the $2 upcharge for fries was a joke. For $2.50 you can get an entire basket of fries, but the two bucks they charge to add them to your burger only gets you about fifteen soggy fries. While the portion size was okay (I ate about two before deciding they were too gross to continue on with), it's nonsense that they charge you so much for a tenth of what comes in a basket that you could just order separately for virtually the same price. \n\nAt the very least, I learned a very important lesson: State Street Brats is best enjoyed by highly intoxicated college students and my time there is over.
Was working and didn't have much time to waste on eating, so we decided to run in here for some brats. The place was pretty empty but apparently it was \"football night\" so they were on their \"football menu\" which was pretty small but had brats which was what I was going for so YAY. I got the white brat and wanted to get a side of cheese curds (...I've still NEVER had cheese curds. Ever.) Apparently they can't do a small side of cheese curds on football night, although it's probably good that this wasn't my first try at them. So I got some onion rings. We also got \"chicken wings\" but didn't realize it said boneless. \n\nThe brat ended up being pretty...megh. There's a bar to add toppings to the brat which was completely gross/dirty/old looking. For some reason I still decided to add some sauerkraut to my brat. It was pretty damn gross. All of the mustard bottles were all sticky. The onion rings were surprisingly good. The onion inside actually tasted like onion, not like some fried string and was juicy. The \"chicken wings\" were like little fried crunchy dough balls with tiny little pieces of chicken. I get it that boneless chicken wings are kind of like small chicken nuggets but this was just ridiculous...you can get better boneless chicken wings at BDubs...
Great place to stop for a sandwich with the family. Brats and burgers are always a hit at State Street Brats.
No stars! Terrible bartender service afternoon 7/5/2014 !  Unless your a cute guy.  Me women  over 50 you cute blonde bartender clearly just about to ask me what I want.  Rude  guy cuts into our space says something funny about a cheeseburger haha and you completely egnore me. Wow!  Not even a haha just one second I was about to help this lady over here. Hope you got a good tip!  Well then again.....  Good luck  and hope you do better with other customers.
Food: the food was good, my only complaint is that they use the bare minimum when it comes to there ingredients. You really don't get the full effect of the Thai dishes. If it you want better portions & consistency, this is not the place.\nService: I waited until my second time eating here to make my review and this is the conclusion that iv come to. \n The service is lacking N HERE's WHY!\n1. The workers look at you like you're  crazy when u walk in instead of asking how many ppl and where would we like to sit. \n2. I also Noticed that they separate the Caucasian ppl from the rest (non-white), by sitting anyone of ethic background outside when there's plenty of room to sit in doors. Not sure how Asians can be racist or bias to any group of ppl. But I seen it with my own eyes.\n3. They never check back with us once the food came out. You have to physically track one of the workers down or go the the desk to and ask for a refill or napkins ect. \n\nLike I said I never like to write a bad review and always try to give the facility to make up for their lack or service, quality of food and professionalism. We all have bad days but it shouldn't be consistent, not if you want returning customers.
Delicious food fast! The food was excellent. We didn't have to wait to sit down, and our fresh food arrived within about 5 minutes from the time we ordered it. Service was excellent. No MSG! They use natural sauces! The tamarind candies they give are delightful!!!
Only had a couple things at this attractive little restaurant - a soup and spring rolls - but I have definitely had better!  The service could be a little more relaxed.  I think I'll stick with Thai House.
What a great lunch stop, food was spicy and fresh. The service was friendly and the elephant table cloths and orchid attire is fitting for the name\n\nMy choice: chicken pad Thai, delicious and hot served for lunch with an spring roll an soup. 4 star experience tasty and prompt
I went to this place again last night and as always I am amazed. I love the location of this place it's nestled in the shopping center in the  shopping center where Fresh Market is located. The setting is very intimate and the decor is fantastic! For my appetizer I ordered the Thai Orchid Spring Rolls the rolls were crispy and delicious and came with a phenomenal peanut sauce. As my entree I ordered the vegetarian Pad Prik King with tofu and it was amazing I requested them to make it spicy and they were able to accomplish that! The dish was full of wonderful veggies in a creamy coconut curry sauce the dish came with rice! Normally I get the pad thai but decided to try something different and I was not disappointed! I would definitely recommend this place the staff is also very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly the prices here are also fairly reasonable!!!
Picked up takeout here this past week and was really impressed, not only with the establishment and service, but also how busy the place was on a Tuesday night. This made me more excited for the meal! Located right behind Fresh Market on Providence/Sardis area, the place is small, but cozy. I called in ahead, so I just walked up to the counter and gave them my name. The food came out right away. There is no bar area, so don't plan on getting a drink while you wait for your order. \n\nOrdered Pad Thai, Pad Woon Sen & Fresh Rolls (spring rolls on steroids). All this for $28. Not bad, as I've paid more and less for the same order at other restaurants. Surprisingly, I got a side of white rice too? Not sure if this is typical or a mistake? \n\nGot home and dove right in as I was starving. Food was really good and the portions were huge. Made for great lunch the next day. Ordered both dishes \"medium spicy\" and the Pad Thai came with a little more heat than the Pad Woon Sen, which was fine as the Pad Thai was for the lady. \n\nI'm a fan and will be back again!
I saw the other reviews and am surprised that my experience was so vastly different. I came in one Thursday night.-a single female They were not busy yet I had to ask for someone to take my order after waiting 15-20 minutes. My menu was closed after a couple of minutes and the wait staff had to keep walking past me since the table I was seated at was near the entrance to the secondary room that seemed more popular with diners so it was not a simple case of oversight.\n\nAfter serving my food, no one ever checked on me again (not one time) and I had to flag someone down to get my check-even though I waited a while after I had pushed my plate away. (Remember, the staff was passing by my table every few minutes)\n\nI was very disappointed in the service and could not help to  wonder if I would have been given better service if I was not a female diner eating by myself.\n\nBy the way, the food was okay nothing exceptional.
Perhaps the best Thai restaurant at which I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Quality food, well-prepared, and excellent friendly service.  Everything on the menu is consistently excellent!
I bought a Livingsocial deal for Thai Orchid. It was a disappointment going to Thai Orchid. It was toally different than what I expected it would be.  This place have the pan fried noodle and it is very rare for restaurants to make the pan fried noodle right. The pan friend noodle was plain taste and nothing special. The noodle soup was bland taste. The vegetable they used in the noodles were cheap. Bunch of cheap onions and baby corn. There were big slice onions not thin onions.The wait staff was nice but honestly the food wasn't good.
The fish and pad Thai here is awesome! I didn't have a good dining experience here for my first visit but I decided to give it another try. It happened to be I didn't order the right dishes. Try pad tai and fish!
I continue trying to like this place but am disappointed almost every time. Tonight's take out was red curry; the shrimp are rubbery and the sauce is especially watery. I also ordered spring rolls, got home, and they were both ripped apart and had tofu...menu didn't mention that part! They were a mess (literally) so I took them back and tried to get veggie spring rolls. Apparently your options are either the vegetables with the meat or the tofu with lettuce. If you want the veggies(carrots, cucumbers, etc) you have to get the meat and if you don't want meat you don't get the veggies....makes no sense! My options were pay $5 for something I can't eat/don't like or go without so I asked for a refund.\n\nLesson learned and I'll stick with Thai House. It's further from my house but I'd rather drive and know the food will be good instead of playing food roulette! $15 for mediocre shrimp curry isn't worth it!
This cute little native Thai family-owned restuarant is a Charlotte staple and it has been tucked away in the center of the Strawberry Hill shopping center for at least the past  12 -15 years (if not longer). \n\nMost of the time, the service is good, but there have been a few misses in this department when they are extremely busy. However, overall I am pleased with the food and service and can overlook the occasional off-day. \n\nThey offer several lunch specials which come with a spring roll or egg roll. They also start you out with a small soup of the day which varies.  \n\nI really like their pad thai here and often get it when I am here for lunch since its usually one of the lunch specials.  For dinner, I like their curries -especially the Penang Curry.  (I have only had one really bad meal here and sadly I cannot remember what I ordered on that visit, but it wasn't one of my \"normal' favs.) \n\nThey season their food for the \"American palate\" so if you like it spicier, just let them know and they will bump it up for you. \n\nThe portions are definitely generous, so I usually have leftovers... I love getting 2 meals for the price of one!  :-)
Being half Thai on my mother side, I would crave for some good Thai food. Unfortunately some other places were good only for some dishes and for this place, it's truly a gem in a hidden area. \n\nThe tom yum is exactly how I would've made it at home. Larb chicken is made just like how my mom would've made it with exception of her adding more lime and chopping the chicken up. \n\nWe also ordered fried chicken for the girls and satay which are both good. For myself, a yellow curry with chicken. Delicious and simple. \n\nFor dessert, mango with sticky rice. Sadly they won't do sticky rice by itself but it's okay. \n\nOverall I enjoyed their little romantic restaurant. Some place where I would like to relax with the mister on date night....away from the girls. :)
Best best Thai I've found in charlotte. The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly. And the food very flavor filled. Order #32 with a fried egg added and you cannot go wrong.
The BEST Thai food I'd found in Charlotte.  The mango sticky rice is eyes-roll-to-the-back-of-the-head delicious!  And the non-dessert items are good too! Friendly owners and service.  Prices are reasonable
I came in last Friday with my wife.  We've been to Thailand before and had everything.  This place is amazing and very authentic.  It's hard to find it but once you find it, it's like finding a pot of gold. We had the traditional pad Thai, which was delicious and flavorful.  The tom yum soup is probably my favorite.  It's full of flavor and spices.  Their currys are very good also.  The staff was very friendly.  We felt like we were in Thailand without the beaches.  Definitely my favorite place for Thai food.
Dropped in for lunch and definitely will be back. Nestled in between the shops and restaurants in the center, it may be hard to find for a first timer. \n\nWarmly welcomed by the guy at the register, invited us to have a seat in the 'indoor' patio area which was quite nice.\nThe selections are typical for Thai food in the America but some I have never seen before or heard of. Straying away from the norm, I opted for a lunch dish chosen pretty much by closing my eyes and picking.\n\nThey were pretty fast at getting the food out and the dishes did not disappoint.  I wish I was closer or I'd come here more often. Definitely a must do if you are nearby and hungry for some Thai.
Great Service, Great Food.  Was in a hurry and they got us in/out of there quick and the food was fantastic.\n\nWill go again when I'm in the area!  Hidden Gem!
My mom and I eat here every time she comes in town. I have never been disappointed. The food is always flavorful and filling. One of my favorites!
With my second experience here, I was not disappointed at all. I got the Thom Yum soup again, with the seafood medley. Full of shrimp, calamari, scallops, and mussels. Simply the best I have had at a restaurant outside of Asia. The Pad Kraprow was also incredible - one of the tastiest dishes (Thai or otherwise) that I have ever had. I am so happy that we have this place in Charlotte! Highly recommended! \n\nNote: This, too, was a delivery order from Foodie Call, so I can't speak for the interior or actual dining experience inside the restaurant.
Edit: Avoid the fresh veggie spring rolls. For $5.95 I got two rolls about 6 inches in length and no more than 1.5 inch diameter. They were like toddler-sized. Inside was lettuce, noodles, and tofu. Fresh and tasty but a total rip-off for $6!\n\n\nPreviously:\nLove this place. Make a foodie call.com delivers their food to my place. While the delivery service is extremely slow- the food is absolutely worth it. I love their pad thai, pad seeewe noodles. I also love their squid salad and fresh spring rolls. Tom yum soup is very sweet salty tasty! I love this place for authentic thai food. Will hopefully get into their actual place. But for now will deal with the slow delivery.
I love Thai food and this place has been on my bucket list for a while.  So when my date said this was their favorite Thai place, it was the perfect opportunity to try it.\n\nThe restaurant is in the Strawberry Square shopping center and sits behind Red Rocks.  The restaurant is small and decor is simple.  \n\nWe arrived and it was dead with only one other table occupied but it quickly filled up.  After looking at the menu, I decided on vegetarian Pad Bai-Krapraw which is similar to Thai dishes I order elsewhere and of course I went with Thai spicy.  \n\nMy date went with a dinner special, Pra Ram Loungsoung which was your choice of meat in a peanut and chili sauce on a bed of spinach.\n\nMy order was perfect with a good mix of veggies, tofu, basil and spice!  The spice level was spot an and cleared out my sinuses..just the way I like it!  The flavor was great as well.\n\nMy date's dinner came out wrong but was quickly corrected and after trying it, it was quiet delicious also.  \n\nService was good and they were nice enough to take my date's item off of the bill since it came out late.  \n\nI definitely think the place is worth returning to.
Thai Orchid is a great dinner option in the SouthPark neighborhood. My husband had the Pad Thai and reported that it was the best in town, but not the best ever. I had the red curry. It had a nice slow heat and a good mix of veggies. Portions were of a good size, and the price was fair for the neighborhood.\n\nWhen we visited, the restaurant was busy, but we were serviced in a timely manner. The wait staff were friendly and attentive. The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, but also feels private and not like you are sitting on top of the next table. Oh, and I really liked the wallpaper, which I realize is kind of a strange thing to say about a restaurant.
Overpriced tasteless fake Thai food.  Service wasn't great either.  Shrimp dishes were overcooked and chewy.  Pan fried noodles were rubbery southern style thick wide pastry strips.  Not enough properly cooked vegetables in soup and/or entrees.
Been meaning to write a review for this place for the longest time now....  It's a great 'hidden gem' since it is not very visible from the corner of Fairview and Providence.\n\nDefinitely my \"go to\" Thai place... everything I have had here has been delicious and the service is great.  I've never tried their take out, but it's probably just as good as eating there minus the relaxed and cozy atmosphere.  \n\nTip:  When mangoes are in season, get the mango and sticky rice dessert!
Best Thai in south Charlotte. The Chicken Fried rice is awesome. Make sure to add spice. I'm a regular.
We got the take out pad see ew tonight. It was not great. The typical pas see ew we've had has a sweet, brown, thick soy sauce. This was a very loose and spicy clear sauce.
Pros: Good food, locally-owned & not a chain restaurant, authentic, fresh food, full of flavor. \n\nCons: Moderately pricey but not too bad, kind of hidden in the strip. \n\nOverall: Tasty and totally worth it, really enjoyed the food. My dining partner has been to Thailand multiple times and agreed the food was \"delightful.\" Worth another trip for sure.
Arrived at restaurant at 840p.  Restaurant owner yelled \"we close at 9\".  I asked what do you want me leave?  Will you kick me out?  He repeated himself.  \"We close at 9\".  I was about to leave when a lady said that she would serve me.  Food was okay not great.  My less than warm welcome left a bad taste.  Felt very unwelcome.
We just moved to Charlotte and have been looking for a place with great Thai food. This place is not for you. It took over 30 minutes to get our noodle dish and over 15 minutes to get our check once we asked for it. They do a lot of to-go business and the dine in people are the ones that suffer. I am only giving 2 stars because I feel bad giving one star.
I've been a fan of this place for years.  The mee krob is delicious, as is their squid salad.  Better at dinner than at lunch, although they have good lunch specials.  I agree that it is the best Thai in Charlotte.
This is my favorite Thai place in the world!  The food, service, and wine menu are great.  Ask for the owner Ed if it is not on the menu he will have the chef make it for you.  Additionally, tell them to bring on the spice they love a challenge.  A must eat place while visiting Charlotte.
I love this place.  The family has eaten here since back in 1987 when they were off central.  The meekrab (sp?) is the owner's unique dish you can't find anywhere else and it is absolutely fabulous.  I could just eat that appetizer alone and be happy.  They also have some great selections in curries from red, yellow, green and the cocunut curry.  They will also adjust anything to your spice level--from mouth on fire to mild.  All the dishes can also be made vegetarian.  The customer service is great--they remember me each time I place a to go order to when I show up with friends.
Hands down one of my favorite place to go for pad thai!! Their curry dish here is good as well. The only issue I have w/ this place is the slow service. Sometimes its really bad and if you get something spicy, be prepare to not have your water refill quickly enough!
I found out about this restaurant through Yelp. It brought me to a new little quaint shopping area I never knew about! It's hidden off of Providence Rd as soon as you pass Fairview Rd on your left. I discovered Phil's Deli and Il Nobe or something like that, an Italian restaurant. I plan to check those out too. \n\nI got the Pad Thai, and it was delicious. Not as big as the Pad Thai from Upstream, but still delicious. Came with an eggroll and some soup. Everything was good, the service was very good and quick. The interior had cute and fancy Thai decor. Very nicely done! Bravo, Thai Orchid.
Best curry in Charlotte! I love that they participate in Foodie Call, so when I can't get out of the office they can come to me!\nMUST TRY: Mee Krob: Crispy rice noodle topped with chicken, water chestnuts and served with crisp lettuce \nMUST TRY: ThumKha: Coconut cream soup with galangal and lemon grass. Your choice of meat (shrimp and chicken are best)\nMUST TRY: #29. Panang * (spicy!) Panang curry paste in coconut cream, bell peppers, kaffir lime leaves. It comes spicy-getting any hotter than it comes and you will need some icecream afterwards. Just sayin'!\nBeautiful restaurant located in the shopping center with Fresh Market. They have excellent service and serve wine and beer. Don't know what to order? They'll help you!
Excellent Thai Food, Service, and Atmosphere.  The pineapple fried rice with spring roll was delicious.  Number 32 with chicken was very tasty and spicy. The server and owner were very friendly and helpful with recommendations.
My wife and I have been wanting to try this place a couple of years now, finally did last night, were not disappointed! Everything we tried was excellent. We had the Mee Krob appetizer (lettuce wraps)
It is a pretty pricy Thai restaurant. But there is not too much competition for them in Charlotte, so you got to go with it. I just like their mee krob.
With the perfect summer week, I am on a quest for the perfect ice cream treat. Kekou Gelato filled that void. I ordered the Small, it was smaller than anticipated, but it satisfied my craving for ice cream and not filling me up as I was on my way to dinner.\nI ordered the Black Sesame, it had the nutty sesame flavour I was anticipating with a cool refresshing iced gelato. Would definitely go back for my next ice cream craving.
A true 5 star find for gelato! They have Asian inspired gelato and the stinky fruit one is sooooo good. Omg, if you also like Vietnamese coffee, they have a gelato flavour as well. Perfect stop for when you are having lunch on Baldwin. This place is across the street from a Mexican restaurant and is near the University of Toronto. Come here for a cold summer treat. Your taste buds will thank you.
Very unique Gelatos. Lots of tropical and Asian flavors.
It's so hard to choose flavours when everything is delicious! We sampled a couple flavours to help us decide but that made choosing even more challenging. A sure sign that many visits to this unique gelato shoppe are in order! The girls who work there are sweet and have a good sense of humour. Try everything!! :)
Wow. \n\nWe passed this gelato bar on our way to Kinton and decided to check it out for dessert post dinner. They had a variety of \"non-traditional\" gelato flavours, most of which are asian inspired.\n\nFrom the list they had, my boyfriend and I tried 4 of them: HK milk tea, whiskey green tea, tsing tao peach, and avocado banana. \n\nLet me just say, the HK milk tea gelato was soooo good. Very rich in milk tea flavour. It was definitely my favorite of the 4. The alcohol infused ones were decent, tsing tao peach reminded me of peach schnapps. And avocado banana - more banana than avocado but still delicious. \n\nI noticed in the take out menu they had toasted pistachio. I sure hope the next time I go they have that for me to try!
I was a bit sceptical about the idea of Asian gelato, but as long as it comes from Kekou it's going to be delicious! I wish there was a way for me to transport a pint of these flavours home, but they'd definitely melt on the 65km trip. \n\nOn my first visit I tried the tapioca pudding gelato - OMG. I wish I had ordered a large. \nNext up, black sesame, divine. I love the Chinese black sesame dessert, but this is even better.  Spicy mango and guava plum salt - all refreshing and delicious unique flavours.  \n\nNo stabilizers (gums) are used in their gelato and it's super fresh. When in the area I always try to make a side trip to Kekou - you should too!
I loved the variety of flavours. The sizes and pricing are very fair and it's cool that you can get 2 flavours in a small.\n\nThe service was very efficient, friendly, and helpful.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try more flavours. \n\nP.S. Durian is interesting, but smells like cat pee.
Kekou Gelato House (@KekouGelato), newly open in Baldwin St is perfectly located with all the Asian restaurant around. While the gelato is made the Italian Way, the flavors are very much Asian Flavored.\n\nLove the space which is bright and sunny with super friendly staff and are all happy to offer samples. After hearing they have Durian gelato, I just had to give it a try\n\nThey offer Non Diary flavors which is different and perfect for lactose intolerant people  \n\n They use traditional Pozzetti Cabinet which keeps the gelato free from contaminants, air and sunshine; keeping it in its original form longer. \nPlus all of their bases are made in house and aged for 10-12 hour.\n\n We got a Medium for $4.25 and choice of 3 flavors.\n\nSpicy Mango\n~ sold in street carts and snacks shop, this gelato totally capture all the flavors\nDurian\n~ A bit lighter then the actual fruit but still very flavorful with bits of fruits in it, so good that we end up buying a whole container home. Stinky goodness!!!\nSoursop \n~ love to get the milkshake at pho/Vietnamese restaurants, so just had to get this frozen version \n\n Verdict :\nNever had Asian flavors gelato anywhere else and I love it\nCan't wait to go back to try the rest of the flavors (^_^)
My goal was to try the durian gelato. Upon entering the store there's this smell that reminds me of home (Malaysia where durian is our national fruit). I don't know why durian is often described for smelling like hell but it smells and tastes like heaven to me. Anyway, back to reviewing gelato. I knew I was getting durian for sure but I tried black sesame and Vietnamese coffee. I found black sesame would be too sweet to pair with durian so I picked Vietnamese coffee. I told the server what I wanted and she asked if I wanna try before \"making such a drastic and bold choice\". Lol. \n\nDuran gelato didn't disappoint at all. It's creamy and pungent - HEAVEN! I wished I picked two scoops of the same flavour. I bet it tastes better than buying those frozen durian from Chinatown. \n\nI would definitely return for more durian gelato and I highly recommend this place!
Best gelato ever! \nNow, I might be slightly biased considering I can't honestly say I've had gelato anywhere else... but Kekou has me addicted.  \n\nIt's a cute little shop really close to work, and I came here two days in a row because the first experience was so impressive.  I've had the Vietnamese coffee flavour, black sesame, durian, and HK milk tea - while all were super indulgent, Vietnamese coffee came out as my clear favourite.  Black sesame is not new to me, but just couldn't get used to the grittiness (not to mention all the bits that must have stuck to teeth afterwards).  I vaguely wonder if they've toned down the durian flavour, since it wasn't as strong as I remember from the actual fruit :P \n\nI don't know if it's just the humid temps the 2 days I visited, but I found that one flavour out of the two in a small cup always melts faster than the other... this gets slightly difficult to enjoy given the tiny plastic scoop (with a tiny indentation as the spoon) before the flavours melt into an indistinguishable soup.  However, I'm well on my way to becoming a regular + completing my first stamp card; the nice price at $3.75 (with tax) for a small doesn't hurt either.\n\nNew favourite dessert place.  This could get dangerous.
Amazing!! This is my second visit to Kekou and still amazing customer service, friendly and attentive staff. Despite the slightly long line up and small space they have, the staff there are very speedy in service, but at the same time does not rush you if you want to try all flavours before you decide. This takes away the pressure and stress for indecisive people like myself. The flavours they have are great. Whisky green tea is strong in both flavours and at the same time very well paired. Roasted Oolong has a pungent tea taste. Unfortunately, I was unable to try the Spicy Salted Pineapple which they did not have today, but maybe I'll save it for my 3rd visit. I bought 2 pints of gelatos today and the staff there, if I have not mentioned one too many times already, are GREAT! Although I was prepared for this and brought with me a cooler bag and ice packets (which they did not know as I kept it in my car), they added in a small bag of ice to keep it frozen without me even asking,\n\nOne small thing to add, they have complimentary self-serve lemon infused water on the side for customers for warm summer days like these or if you just want to wash the sugar off your pallet after you have enjoyed your choice of gelato. \n\nI work in customer service and is a food lover, I can say that there is quality with the product and their staff. :)
Ice cream. It makes the world go round. This place is conveniently located next to the Japanese gift shop, and offers a variety of different flavors. All really tasty and delicious. Plus the girls working are really nice and soft-spoken. All in all a pleasant experience!
I tried this place after eating ramen and lovedddd it!!! I didn't expect such natural flavours considering they offered so many different types of unusual flavours. Upon entering, the workers allowed me to try as many flavours as I wanted. The flavour is not artificial at all and is very delicate. I had the strawberry lychee (sorbet; non-dairy) and the milk tea (dairy), which were both fantastic. Would love to visit again!!\n\nThe price is right for gelato. Especially because we get to have two flavours in a cup!
This place is a yes for me, the gelato flavors are unusual but tasty. I think my favorite is their jasmine soft serve it is soo goood. They have moved to queen west.
falling in love immediately with this place just first time came here. I love everything about this place! unique ice-cream flavours, my best best is spicy salted pineapple, extremely friendly lovely staff, simple space but casually, relaxing atmosphere.\nIt seems the ice cream flavours are seasonal, but still a variety of choices: vietnamese coffee, oolong tea, whiskey green tea, rice wine, black sesame, sour op, durian, ect. Add a little bit more for a fresh made cone would never be disappointing.
In this age of me too Gelato places, it is refreshing to see a different take on the Italian dessert.  The flavours are actually unique and not the typical vanilla and stracciatella.  Not that there is anything wrong with the tried and true.  It's just nice to see someone offering something different in the city.  \n\nLocation is good on Baldwin, with other neighboring restaurants close by.  Benches outside are nice for the patrons.  Inside is decorated nicely with a view of the person actually making the gelato so we know it's not sourced somewhere else like other places.  \n\nTried a few flavours, Jasmine tea (too strong), ginger milk (spicy!), yogourt (very nice), banana avocado (more banana than avocado).  If anything the flavours are a bit strong but some people may prefer that.  Will try other flavours on other visits.  Quantity and quality are very good for the dollar.  If you're in the area, worth a visit.
I've been here about 5 times already and still haven't had a single bad experience. Very unique flavours that you won't find anywhere else! My favourites are HK Milk Tea, Black Sesame (omg so goodddd), Pistachio Rosewater, Viet Coffee and Oolong Tea. The durian one is pretty good as well if you like it. Definitely recommend visiting this place! They have a punch card too so even more incentive to come back! Haha. The ladies there helping are also very patient so you can taste test some flavours before you commit to getting a full scoop!
Discovered this place by accident while having Ramen near Baldwin. Very quint little settlement. All home made and unique flavors!! \nI had the ginger milk, durian and jasmine tea! They were all superb!!!\n\nGotta try them out if u like Asian centric flavors. It Doesn't have normal flavors, but if u want that, just go to the grocers and get ur self tub of Generic brand.  \n\nThey also have soy based gelato, good for people that can't take dairy.\n\nI will be back for more, maybe buy a tub to serve at home!
This is my go-to Gelato House. I like durian paired with a sweet flavour. The Vanilla Lotus Bean has real vanilla and fat Lotus beans. The choice of flavours is large. Try them all!
My husband and I are a fan of Kekou Gelato House. I like the unique and interesting flavours that this place provides. He's a huge durian lover and I absolutely can't stand the smell. I would say, the smell and taste of the Durian flavour gelato is really true to how the actual fruit is. Very rare you would get to have such an option in grocery stores/ asian supermarkets. I hate the durian real fruit and therefore, the gelato doesn't make me want to eat it anymore-- but HE LOVES IT! TRY it if you love DURIAN!!\n\nI am a fan of coffee (Anything coffee flavour!!) I'm so used to yummy creamy coffee flavour of Haagen Daaz. I truly enjoy the vietnamese coffee though! Its such a strong smell and full of heavy coffee flavour! we would buy TUBS of this back home to eat!\n\nI also quite like the black sesame! I like the little bits of sesame seeds grinder into the gelato! I like how the sesame flavour is so strong as well. I can't find these flavours in the asian supermarket (they often taste too sweet and creamy). \n\nI also really enjoy the HK MILK tea flavour! Such a unique taste-- as if you're drinking the actual drink!! \n\nReally good place! \n\nSeating: it's busy there but not too bad. At least the store is big enough to find a little bench or table to sit down and enjoy your gelato!
Go here and don't think twice. Awesome and creative flavour combinations combined with really friendly service make kekou my new favourite gelato place! They encourage you to taste so many different flavours. I had peanut sesame and viet coffee but you really can't go wrong with anything here.
Love this place! The viet coffee, oolong tea, and black sesame flavours are must-try's. Just wish that they were open all year round...
The food & selection (4.5/5): I've been here more than ten times and I was never disappointed. Their gelato flavours are one of the most interesting I've seen. My favorites are Vietnamese coffee, green bean coconut and oolong milk tea. You can choose to have your gelato in a cup or a cone (which there are also several flavours). For fruity one, I like soursop. They also have soft serves in jasmine tea and almond tofu flavours, with this year's 2 additions, yogurt and passion fruit (dairy free), offered only during summer though. They also offer various types of drinks in this location. \n\nCost (3/5): $5 after tax for a medium cup with two flavours. They adjusted their price recently. A small one is cheaper than before ($3) but you only get one scope of one flavour. The large cup costs $7 I believe. They also changed the way they fill the ice cream. They used to fill the two flavors side by side and pack as much into the paper cup as they could. But now it's by scoop and they stack one on top of the other. So I think the medium cup i got this time was less than what I used to get. \n\nService (4/5): You can sample before getting an entire scope (which helps a lot since they have all these exotic flavours like spicy pineapple, green tea whiskey, rosewater pistachio, durian...). Staffs are quite friendly about it. You also get a stamp for each ice cream purchase. When you have collected 10 stamps, you'll be able to redeem a free one. \n\nAmbience (3.5/5): The place is always busy and they have only a bench near the door, and two long tables and a round one in the store. You'll almost feel like you want to get out right after you're done so other people can sit - so it might not be the best place if you want to chill, talk and hang out with friends.
When Asian flavors meet Italian ice cream, you get Kekou Gelato. Very difficult to choose what flavor(s) to get but the staff is very accommodating and will let you sample whatever you'd like and do so with a smile. I've been to many similar places that seem a little stingy with their samples. Not the case at Kekou.\n\nI ended up getting a scoop of rice wine milk and a scoop of osmantus plum berry. I don't even know what either is really but they pleased my tastebuds. I liked how the fruitiness of the plum berry mixed with the creaminess of the rice wine milk.  Good combo!  \n\nIt's a little bit of a stroll through a residential area to get there from Chinatown but not too bad. Indoor and outdoor seating, so you can enjoy gelato regardless of the weather.  Flavors change according to what fruits are in season so they give you plenty of reasons to come back and have a loyalty card to reward you.
If you love Asian inspired gelato, this is the place to go!  I tried the Hong Kong milk tea, Vietnamese coffee and durian and it is mouth-watering.  You can really taste the flavour of the gelato.  \n\nThey also have a stamp card so if you get nine gelatos you'll get one free.
This place is fantastic, and ties with Greg's Ice Cream for one of my favorite dessert places in the city.\n\nI've always liked black sesame ice cream and I've found it difficult to find in Toronto, but then Kekou came around and blew me away - it's better than any black sesame ice cream I've had in my life. I especially like the texture because they make it in-house, you can find bits of sesame seeds in your gelato.\n\nThey also have durian flavour, which I love, because it tastes exactly like durian, and doesn't seem to have extra sugar or anything added to it to modify the taste. The texture is creamier than the black sesame too, which is appropriate for durian. Durian's awesome, haters gonna hate.\n\nBe sure to sample several flavours before you make your choices!
My fav place!!  I always come here when I'm in the area, and also make a detour when I'm not :D   My favourite flavour is black sesame, but I've tried so many others and none had disappointed.  If you are having a hard time choosing, ask to sample flavours!  Also, since I know you'll be returning, get a stamp card ;)
I have been to Kekou numerous times and every single time Kekou is clutch and satisfies my sweet tooth. On my most recent visit it was a hot Friday afternoon and I got a scoop of their newer flavours - almond tofu gelato.  It was just sweet enough to not leave that sugary after taste in your mouth and it was perfect for a hot afternoon.  At this location they don't have soft serve so I'm very excited to visit the Queen St. location to try their soft serve next time :)
So adorable.  The staff are helpful and quick.  The flavours are so inspired by the husband and wife creators and owners.  I really enjoyed the black sesame and green bean coconut flavours.  If you like coffee then Vietnamese coffee is the way to go.  Next time will go for durian flavour!!  The small cup with 2 flavours is more than enough to satisfy my craving since they do a great job of packing them into the cup.\n\nIt is great that they have water for drinking and condensed milk available nearby.  Cute interior and adorable designs.
My friends and I during our trip in Toronto suddenly developed a craving for durian. We found this place on yelp that serves durian gelato and decided to check it out and satisfiy our urges.\n\nThe place had a wide variety of unique flavors, we decided to get a pint of Hong Kong milk tea and durian gelato. The Hong Kong milk tea gelato was amazing, tasted just like the milk tea with a really creamy texture. The highlight of the visit, durian gelato. It was amazing, the taste of durian with the creaminess of gelato. There were bits of durian in the gelato as well, simply amazing. Will definitely come back for more durian and maybe try the other flavors.
This gelato place is amazing and I always want to come here whenever I go downtown. They have so many Asian inspired flavours and I don't have anything to complain about it. I've been here numerous occasions and recommend it to all of my friends. \nI've tried many flavours such as Vietnamese coffee, HK milk tea, whiskey green tea, black sesame, green bean coconut etc... I wish I lived closer so I could go more often because this cute little shop is a must during any trip downtown. \nThey allow customers to sample their flavours and the team members are quite friendly and helpful. It can get a bit busy at times but it's worth the wait.
Very Interesting unique flavors, I love the Vietnamese Coffee and green tea whiskey if you want to experiment things. The flavors are strong and lasting, a good quality place to be. They also give you a voucher that can be stamped after each purchase and you unlock free goodies. \n\nIf you want to sit, they offer limited space inside and outside. I gave this place 4 stars because I found the gelato to be rather on the expensive side. \n\nNevertheless, a must go for all these exotic and interesting Asian flavors.
Great flavours.  Great service.  Great everything.  This is fantastic gelato.  It's a little on the pricey side - but it offers things that no other gelato place makes.\n\nAlso - they make it without preservatives, and other such nonsense a lot of places add to make the stuff last if it doesn't sell.\n\nThis place is charming.
Like all the other reviews written here - it is seriously one of the best gelato places I've been.\n\nThe first time I had was the Tsing Tao Peach.  What a combination!  You can really distinctively taste the peach mix with the Tsing Tao (which is a Chinese beer btw).  It's sweet, refreshing (perfect for the summer) and you can a little tipsy from it.\n\nOther flavors I recommend include the Green Tea Whisky, Makegolli, Viet Milk Tea, HK Style Milk Tea, Seasame (THE BEST!).\n\nYou can order 1 or 2 flavors.  If it's your first time, definitely do more variety so you can know which ones you like.  If you're with a few friends, get a wide variety and share!\n\nThey also provide sampling if you're not sure how it will taste like (very nice and friendly staff).  You can also buy a tube home if you definitely know you want more of this delicious stuff!\n\nRemember to collect and bring your stamp card!
Overall: Best place to get great-valued unique-flavoured ice cream that actually taste good!\n\nLocation: Situated on Baldwin Street a couple minutes from St. Patrick Station.\n\nPrice: Around $5 for 2 scoops. They also have a stamp card because, honestly, you're coming back. \n\nFood: They have really unique and delicious tea flavours, such as HK milk tea or roasted oolong, it's a great place to start. If you're feeling a bit more adventurous, there's salted spicey pineapple, rum and raisins, etc. Honestly, I'm not sure why these flavours aren't everywhere because I personally love them much more than the generic tastes! They're also really nice about letting you try flavours. The only issue is after trying 3, you have to heartbreakingly eliminate one, or binge on 3 flavours. I went there so much last summer (often by myself because there's no shame in self love), that I had to modify my route home just so I don't pass by it all the time.
This place is always packed everytime I've come here! Ok, I've only just learned about this place so really I've only been here twice, but each time it's packed. I love their flavours. I used to have to make these flavors at home. But now that there's a ice shop that gets me, I am a fan and project that I will be packing on lots of weight thanks to them! I always get the durian because I love durian, but their other ones are good too. Black sesame is awesome. Soursop is delicious. Avocado-banana, I'm still trying to come up with a judgement on, but hey, it's different and that's a good quality!
Asian Gelato heaven!!! oh my wow!!! \n\nso I have never had Asian inspired Gelato before and it was so interesting to see the many different flavours this shop had to offer. from spicy sweet, salty sweet, to sour sweet. they had everything.\n\nthe place was cute and I don't know if its just me but this place looked like we picked it up from japan and plopped it right in the middle of Baldwin street. LOL. \n\nthe flavours I have tried were the chocolate ginger (very interesting mix) I would eat that if I was sick because ginger is good for sore throats, but I ended up with a scoop of red bean white chocolate ( probably the best read bean ice cream/gelato I have ever tasted), my friend who was with me had the spicy pineapple and oh me oh my that was an a good, interesting flavour . \n\nthey also had sesame flavour and other cool and interesting flavour. I would for sure bring my family here to try it out, and I am for sure coming back :)
This is my fave place for ice-cream. I prefer these flavours over BangBang. And because it's actually gelato, it's lighter and has less fat. \n\nThe green bean coconut and peanut sesame are so addictive!!!
So many Asian-inspired flavours!  \n\nSpicy mango, guava with plum, HK milk tea, peanut and sesame, vietnamese coffee, etc...  The list goes on!\n\nYou can get two flavours in the small or medium cups, three flavours in a large.  You can also purchase a larger styrofoam container for take-out.  \n\nDon't forget to ask for the frequent buyer's card!  I'm sure you will be back!
I ordered the HK milk tea and pistachio rose water gelato. It was delicious! And such a good deal. Very much worth it! 10/10 recommend this place!
If you're craving gelato amongst Toronto humidity, this is the place to go! Stopped by here after dinner for dessert with friends. The flavour I tried was almond tofu - which was basically almond ice cream with a hint of tofu flavour. One scoop in a cup was $3.50, and it was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth! \n\nThere are lots of other unique flavours to choose from - including HK milk tea, pistachio rosewater, oolong tea, green tea whiskey, etc - which I would also recommend (tried my friends'). \n\nOne thing to note: there were no vegan/dairy free options available at the time but they did say they would make the option available soon, so hopefully that will be in place soon as sometimes dairy can get me and I would love to have the option of choosing coconut milk based ice cream instead.
Holy moly. Oh my goodness. Go here. \n\nIf you like that soft serve stuff in any of its reincarnations (cones from McDonalds, Menchies and other pay-by-weight places where you load your chemical soft serve with skittles, Twizzlers, and sour keys), either you'll hate this place or if you are open to new experiences - you'll be blown away. Fact: I am not like the person I described above.\n\nI love gelato, more specifically, I love home-made/made on premise gelato. Ok where do I start? I love the concept of this place - what an amazing idea. It brings all of my favorite flavours to a medium that is so widely accepted! The quality of the gelato is excellent so I think it will help encourage ppl experience new flavours that they otherwise may not have any interest in, like Sour sop, Green bean, Durian, Lotus Seed, Red bean, Black Sesame, etc. They do it creatively as well by mixing it with something more familiar, like Vanilla lotus seed and coconut green bean. Of course they have familiar flavours as well, like strawberry-lychee and mango.\n\nThe product is very good - smooth, silky, creamy. Very clean with no aftertaste. The right consistency and not icy at all. I tried the black sesame (features crushed black sesame seeds for an interesting texture), banana avocado (more banana than avocado, but avocado doesn't really have a bold flavour so I think this imbalance keeps it from being bland. very creamy), vanilla lotus seed (has half lotus seeds in it), and cashew (creamy, tasted like cashews).\n\nThe service was excellent. The customer in front of me tried too many flavours despite the long line up behind him (sample abusers ARE THE WORST) and the counter help was still so nice. Service with a smile. They are also very happy to give recommendations. There's no seating inside, but they have benches outside which is nice, and great to sit on to enjoy Baldwin street on a beautiful summer night. Probably not ideal in the winter but who cares. \n\nI love that they serve their gelatos out beneath the counter containers like they do in Italy. The counter is in an L shape with small labels on the glass. The flavours are also written outside on a chalk board, and posted inside on a board. They must make their gelato in small batches because I was there around 8 or 9 and they were sold out of 5-8 different flavours.\n\nLast point: Since extensively travelling Italy years ago with my BFF, I've had a love affair with gelato. I am willing to pay a premium for a good product b/c there are too many unnatural (aka bad) tasting gelatos out there. Luckily, for $3.75 (small) you get a good sized amount and get to try two flavours so it's easy on the wallet and for a very satisfying amount. Def looking forward to going back and trying out the flavours I missed out on.
HK milk tea gelato is wonderful! Lots of asian flavors like black sesame, vietnamese coffee, red bean.
Had the red bean and chocolate and rosemary pistachio. Amazing. Loved them. If you want to try new ice cream flavours, it's the place to go.
*Breathes deeply* \n\nKekou is the epitome of quirky, Asian-inspired fro yo and gelato.  If you've been to East Asia and was lucky enough to dine on the geographically \"exclusive\" durian and tofu flavoured ice cream/gelato, then you have to wiggle your behind over to Kekou!  Kekou manages to banish all elements of geographical boundaries, serving notable flavours, such as durian, almond tofu, Vietnamese coffee, jasmine tea, whiskey green tea, rosewater pistachio, and the list goes on.\n\nMany of these dairy goodies are made in-house and none of them have preservatives, stabilizers, food colouring, dextrose, corn syrup, soy lecithin, and etc.  I give this a big thumbs up, because you see too many products out there labeled as \"frozen dairy desserts\" rather than desserts made with real milk and cream without all the unpronounceable chemicals and additives. \n\nMy usual go-to is the durian gelato, which comes to no surprise (re: my name).  This time around, however, I opted for the Rosewater Pistachio gelato and the Almond Tofu gelato, partly because I have been on the rosewater beauty bandwagon for some time now and partly because tofu has always been a great ingredient in East-Asian desserts for as long as I can remember.  Both gelatos had great flavour.  They didn't taste water-downed or too \"in-your-face\".  They tasted very refreshing, actually, so much so that you wouldn't think you were eating anything unhealthy at all!\n\nKekou's staff members are very friendly and are eager to let you sample any of their concoctions during your visit.  Need a cup of joe every morning? Then grab the Vietnamese Coffee.  Love your original bubble tea?  Try the HK Milk Tea or Jasmine Tea.  Need a bit of \"adult\" zing in your dessert? Then I highly recommend the Whiskey Green Tea (another personal favourite).  From what I've seen, they rotate their flavours, so sometimes you'll be lucky enough to find the soy bean/kinako gelatos and some other ginger varieties (right now, they have Chocolate Ginger, but I'm not a chocolate fan).  \n\nKekou has been my HG dessert joint since its inception and I think it will remain in this place, even in the face of iHalo Krunch (which has charcoal and ube ice cream), Pablo (Japanese cheese tart master), and the ever-expanding Japanese cheesecake fad.  Their prices are very similar to those found at Dairy Queen, Basket Robbins, and etc., so there really isn't anything to lose!
Excellent! Had the great fortune to sit at the chef's table and watch the culinary genius of Chef Chris Kalisperas. Our table of 5 tasted more than half of the menu:  starting with the flavourful dips like you've never had before, fresh in-house warm pita bread, succulent octopus, exquisite quail, Greek cheese served at the perfect temperature, lamb chops that were so meaty and seasoned just right, unique goat tartare, to lamb sausage with skordalia (like mashed potatoes but pur\u00e9ed with garlic and oil).  Even the village salad which was simple marinated tomatoes with fresh feta was fantastic. Chef Kalisperas knows the trick of using top quality ingredients in interesting combinations and allowing the flavours to tantalize your tastebuds. Gather a few friends and enjoy an evening dining experience extraordinaire at Mamakas Taverna!
I would give this place minus 5 stars if I could. I was walking by that place with a friend at around 1 pm when we saw a guy grilling a lamb outdoors. We were tempted to try it and the guy and his buddy told us to come after 3 pm to try it. When we came at 3:05 they closed the place in front of us. I was really surprised and asked their hostess how is it possible that they invite people to come at times when they're closed. She spoke to the \"lamb guy\" and invited us in (he was nice). Inside we were ambushed by a very arrogant manager who didn't even apologize for what happened. He was happy to tell us that they are closed and no more lamb left. \"Come after 5 pm for dinner serve\" he said. I'll be honest I was already reluctant to go, but in the end of the day you only live once. We came there at 5:30. The same manager didn't even say hi, though he clearly made contact with both of us on multiple occasions. The hostess offered us seats a the bar next to the smoky kitchen. As a side note she asked if we have reservations (we didn't but why couldn't she offer us to make reservation when we spoke to her earlier that day?!). It took 20 minutes and 3 reminders for waitress to arrive. During this time we had an opportunity to overlook some food burning on the grill, and their manager and chef badmouthing pedestrians. In the end of the day the waitress arrived and told us that we can't have this lamb as it will be ready only in a couple of hours. We left of course. This place truly sucks and I will never ever come there again. What a f***ing waste of time! I normally don't write reviews on Yelp, but I had to post it as it simply unacceptable!
Brilliant, sophisticated, classy, and ambient is the best way I can describe this Greek gem at Ossington and Queen.\n\nWe ordered Melitzanosalata, from their 4 delicious dips at $7.00 each. It was the most delicious melody of authentic Olive oil and strawberry and honey flavoured thick Greek yogurt which came with a side of the thickest garnished lightly oiled pita bread. We also ordered an appetizer called Halloumi (goat/sheep cheese) infused with corn, Peaches, and Pistachios. It was extremely unique and delicious.\n\nFor our entr\u00e9e we ordered half chicken and grilled calamari. Chicken was nicely crispy and grilled and came infused with thick Greek yogurt and mango chutney. Grilled calamari was also infused in a gourmet sauce.\n\nAs I was enjoying my decadent meal I was having hard time believing I was eating Greek food. This place is as authentic, delicious, and gourmet as it gets. And the prices are not that steep which makes it even more attractive. I didn't order dessert this time but will definitely be back for their pear cake and baklava which was being served behind me with a scoop of rich vanilla ice cream.
Went with the family on Sunday night. \nThe place was busy ,loved vibe. \nThe food was excellent!!!!!!!\nFresh and tasty and the service was super friendly. \nWe are coming back foshu.
Great Spot - Super Busy and Super loud , went in with a group of 10 .. we had a prix fix menu which was great as it gave us an opportunity to try a lot of the menu. The food was great loved the spanakoptia (sp) - Lamb chops were on point and Octopus was very good. The only area i saw this fail in was the service, I can respect the place is busy but waiting 15mins for a 2 cocktails was a bit much. ALso for one reason or another our waitress kept forgetting to clear our plates ? so as food kept coming she was struggling to find space to put our food down (we did sharing style) so eventually we just helped her along with piling all the plates together. The desserts were fantastic we had the ice cream and backlava (sp) - they were also very good.. would have given 5 stars if only i could find space to put my drink down LOL .. great resto you wont be disappointed
Easily one of the best meals I've had anywhere. I love Greek food.  The extremely knowledgable waiter helped us select the best bottle of white wine which went perfectly with the lite, nearly mousse like taramasalata, grilled pita, olives and grilled Octopus.  \n\nSo simple at first glance, but each dish was created from meticulously selected and costly imported ingredients prepared with a variety of methods ranging from pickling, sous vide, grilling and braising. Truly a wonderful meal made better by its spontaneity. (Planned to go to union based on recommendations but they were booked for the night). I will be back EVERY TIME I visit Toronto.\n\nPlace is a little tight, but feels homey while being a bit contemporary and clean. Pricey and portioned conservatively, but so worth it. \n\nDefinitely give it a shot.
Very nice ambience and great service. Quality of food was great. Best lamb ever. Make sure you try olive oil ice cream! Very interesting. This place is going to be a fave for us from now on.
Extraordinary staff, a gorgeous venue, and some of the best hummus I've ever had in my life makes this an amazing venue. The spanakopita is to die for, too. Great place for a date, but make sure you plan in advance, as this place is super busy.
Really wanted to enjoy this place. As many people have said here they heard great things and were excited to try this food. Our experience unfortunately fell short of what we expected.\n\nCured swordfish. 3.5/5: - ok flavour. Under seasoned. \n\nCheese Saganaki. 1/5: Maybe we don't know Greek food, but this was was basic. You could get this at any bar. Its a bunch of cheese melted in a cast iron skillet with some figs and raw walnuts. A joke.\n\nLamb. 2/5: Anyone saying this is the best lamb in the city is a joke. It was overcooked and under seasoned. Cold when it arrived. We can not stress enough - this is not the best lamb in the city.\n\nOctopus. 3/5: Slightly over cooked. Underwhelming dish in our opinion.\n\nGreens. 3.5/5: Green beans that you can make at home. Made at Mamakas.\n\nCocktails. 5/5: Great drinks.\n\nCan't stress enough that this place is over-rated and over-priced. Read the reviews and you will see consistently that the dishes above receive the same criticism - with the occasional fanboy raving about how the tzatziki is the best they ever had. So many better options.
Beautiful room, grill is hot and food is quite nice.  Nice service\nTouch pricey but kind of worth it\nUpscale Greek
Food: What can I say this place is Amazing!!!\n\nService: Was number one, my glass was never empty.\n\nOrdered: Spanakopita, Tzatziki Dip, Chicken, Pork sausage, I was completely full by the end of all that.
Favourite Greek spot in town. Rahil was our waiter and treated us like family. Lamb chops and sea bream fish was the best I've ever had, grilled, baked and torched afterwards.
Had dinner at the chefs bar with a good friend. As expected for a Saturday, the place was really bustling, line up at the door the whole night. The atmosphere is great, beautiful room, upbeat music and a well run kitchen banging out amazing food. It is family style dining so we had 5 or 6 dishes that were all a good size. By far the best was the grilled Octopus, it was actually the best I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection and paired wonderfully with peas. I can't wait to go back and try the lamb chops as they looked amazing! Service was attentive and pleasant. Will definitely go back and spread the good word.
Go with a group of 6 and order as much as you can. Everything is so flavourful and the service was stand out. Our server gave us recommendations on how much to order to ensure we are full and get the true experience. Not your typical Greek restaurant...and that is a good thing. The decor is clear and makes you feel at home all at the same time. I loved the octopus.
For starters, I would recommend the olives and the taramosalata/kopanisti house dips. Very different textures but great beginners. The grilled octopus was tender to perfection. We ordered the grilled Ontario lamb and I have had better so I wouldn't order it again. For dessert, try the baklava with honey + milk ice cream. We also ordered the olive oil ice cream but it crumbled (not smooth and creamy like gelato). It did taste better when we let the ice cream melt slightly. Aside from food, the service was impeccable, very friendly!
Fantastic service and food, the waiters were great but the busboy was a hustler, we all watched him worked and we felt we would hire him in a heartbeat. Bartender was great, I loved my drink. The piece de resistance of the evening was the Octopus, although everything else was awesome, we all loved the octopus. Our waiter said, the kalamari was great but the Oct0pus is amazing. We got both. Next time I am in Toronto I will return. ( the space is also really nice).
Food ****1/2\nService ***\nAmbience ****\n\nThese folks have it going on!  I've walked past here a hundred times and thought it was a cafe.  I'm glad I found this spot.  \n\nAs we were a larger group, we ordered a number of dishes including lamb, chicken, Greek salad, Octopus, Greek Salad and a few others.  \n\nThe standouts were the Greek salad and (surprisingly) the chicken.  Both were exceptional. The Greek salad olives (paste) were so flavourful - I'm glad some folks at the table didn't like olives and I got to go to town on it!\n\nThe group and 3 bottles of wine and a few cocktails.   Bill came to under $100 including an t&t (18% grat), which was reasonable in my opinion for that much food and a good helping of alcohol.   Service was good at the start, however towards the end when I finished my drink and was looking to get another, our server was nowhere to be found.
Just what we needed on a Sunday stroll on Ossington. The food is beautifully presented and tastes as good as it looks. Super fresh ingredients and made to order.
Guys you smell like your menu. No excuses. Tempted by the Greek menu and the nice decor.... Regretted our choice with the first course.... Beside the good wine and tender octopus, there is clearly a disconnect between what you project and the actual experience. We are still trying to air our jackets and disappointment
So... first of all it's the first Greek restaurant that feels Greek without using 25 pictures of Acropolis and another 43 of Santorini!\nSo atmosphere is really nice.\nThe Greek recipes are very interesting but the portions are ridiculously small. So small that I've lost one of the meatballs in my mouth. Maybe I swallowed it, don't know.\nYes, some products are imported, most are vegetables but still, I know the costs and it doesn't add up to $18 for 2 bites of Greek salad. The green beans were the biggest I've ever seen so GMO was the first thing that came in my mind.\nThe taste was really good no complaints there but definitely not a traditional Greek food, and It's not very nice to leave a restaurant hungry and a bit furious when you see the total $.\n\nWe'll go back for sure for drinks and an appetizer but not if we are hungry.\nRegulars if they double the portions (not the prices)
Through all of its aspects the experience at Mamakas has left me with a sense of having tasted, aside from the food, a bit of that \"plain sybarite\" aesthetic that exerts such a vibrant hold on the greek rural and insular atmosphere. Been here twice and loved it both times. It is pricey, but a worthwhile expense every once in while, if you feel like treating yourself to perfect food and great wine in an uplifting environment. I've only visited weekday evenings and even though the place was fully booked, atmosphere was chill and service pleasant, laid back yet casual. Food was a delight, and so was the wine. Their cocktail menu is a great reason for paying yet another visit in the near future.
We loved this place. Stopped in on a busy weekday night and quickly got a seat at the kitchen. We would highly recommend sitting there when you dine here.\n\nWe quickly fell in love with the atmosphere and friendliness of the staff. We ordered the rose which was crisp, refreshing and light. It paired perfectly with the smoked trout appetizer. The food was absolutely fantastic, both complex and authentic.
Many over priced Greek restos dot the city, and I always considered this to be one of them. Its location and popularity with the instagram set didn't help. Boy was I wrong! \n\nService: 4.5 Very friendly and helpful\nDeco: 4.75\nApps: 4-4.5\nMain: 4.5-4.75 Yum! (Heard octopus is best avoided from fellow foodie)\nDesert: 4.75 (pick the first two options,which includes the bakalava)\nValue: 4 little pricey\n\nRepeat: Yeah! \n\nTotal score: 4.75\n\nOverall one of my favourite discoveries in a long time on the TO food scene. I have to thank my fellow Yelper and sis-in law for dragging us here.
Great food.  I am usually the carnivore out of the group,  but decided to try most of the vege options and truly enjoyed them. Service by James and the kitchen staff was quite welcoming and hospitable.
Proper greek food. Proper service. Wine list is just awesome - all greek wines which I never ever get. But the server was able to guide me to a very 'pinot noir'-esque recommendation that was perfect. Get lots of pita... tons of opportunities to dip in just about any dish you get. Ill be back!
The food was very average and it took a long time to prepare.  The hostess had a major attitude, and the server was quite clueless.  Overall, it isn't a good value for money place.  I will not return.
Absolutely fantastic food, cocktails, service and ambiance. The most excellent bottle of Greek wine. We went for a bite, but stayed a long time and just kept eating and drinking. Wonderful all around!
Loved this place for its authentic feel, charisma, the service was stellar, and the small but delightful dishes were made to perfection.  The service/waiters were on the ball the entire time, so friendly, and helpful.  Also,we met the owner, Thanos, and he was a perfect gentleman and lovely to us, and we will definitely go back.  It's not really in our area of convenience, but it is definitely worth the trip and its in a cute quaint part of Ossington which seems to also be booming.  Overall, GREAT GREEK DISHES, beautiful d\u00e9cor and feel;  keep up the great work and congrats on a fab new joint to the area..it's not always easy to pull off greek cuisine so authentically and accurately while still being unique!  will definitely go back :)
Amazing staff. Great vibe. Declicious food. I've been twice. It's a great addition to the Ossington strip.
Pricey, mediocre food. For brunch, it's a no. Youre paying for the ambiance, i like to pay for my food.\n\nWe went for brunch. I was banking on them having what looked to me like the best item on their menu--custard pie, bougatsa--but they didn't have it and thus i was forced to find something else on the menu, which did not impress me. We settled for the baklava inspired french toast but it was not good: dry and unflavourful. We also shared the white omlette which was equally unmemorable and the melizanosalata which was not as tasty as it seemed to be. It didnt seem as though the establishment was willing to make concessions for us--if we could take two dips rather than a full portion, or get sufficient syrup for the french toast that was particularly dry..... for the price, they really should be more open to better customer service.\n\nThe place was expensive and again, unimpressive. Would not recomend for brunch.
This was a fun change of pace.\nLoved the pitas and the taramsalta dip was great. By far the most generous portion as well.\nThe swordfish crudo was elegant clean flavors with radish and peppers but a tiny portion.  However it was delicious. \n\nGoat Tartare was great loved the texture and the beets. Portion was ok but smallish. I'd definitely get this again.\n\nOctopus was excellent but small for a main. It would have seemed small for an app. \n\nGreat cocktails and a decent red wine. \nThe baklava ice cream dessert was delicious a perfect fit for the menu.\n\nThe space is great, the tables are tight however. \n\nWould i go back? Yes but not if I'm super hungry. But the flavor was perfect.
I've had Mamakas on my list of \"go to\" restaurants for a while and it met all of my expectations! I went there with a girlfriend for dinner last night and the food was so delicious. As a half greek myself, and having been exposed to a lot of real Greek food in my life, this restaurant held its own quite well!\n\nFirst off, our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. After we ordered he offered us a new menu item on the house to get our opinion (yes please!)\n\nWe ordered the keftedes (beef and mint meatballs) and Greek salad to start and the item on the house was the saganaki with apricot & honey. The keftedes were nice and light with the mint sauce and the Greek salad was very traditional without lettuce and lots of feta but the saganaki was by far our favorite. The saganaki is on the menu without the apricot but the sweet and salty pairing was absolutely amazing! Hopefully they add it to the menu soon so everyone else can try because it was to die for.\n\nAs a main course I had the fish of the day which was sea bream and my friend ordered the moussaka which is a Greek version of lasagna/Sheppard's pie. The fish was a whole fish, head and all, dressed with lots of lemon, oregano and olive oil (yum)! The moussaka had the same flavors as my Greek relatives make so I was very impressed. As recommended from our waiter, we also ordered a side of red peppers which were also sweet and delicious!\n\nOverall, I would 100% go back! Food was amazing and authentic, service was friendly, atmosphere was lively - couldn't have asked for more!
This super cool spot is the closest experience to Santorini without hopping on a plane. \nThe food and ambience are both authentic enough to leave out the funny \"opa\" references and blue & white flags. I really enjoyed my time here. I even perched myself at the bar ordering as much as possible to observe it all being prepared before my eyes. Delicious, savoury, clean and trendy. Go here.
Wanted to love this place. Very nice atmosphere, good friendly unpretentious non-hipster service. Wine was good. Tzatziki was great. But it all went downhill after that. Eggplant dip was under spiced and overly date-y. Some pita was quite burnt so I requested (and was charged $5) for another one. Was told sea bass is almost always a special and very popular so I ordered it. Was later told at 6:15pm it was sold out. Had snapper instead - doused in oregano.\n\nGreek restaurant with no potatoes (sorry cheese fries don't count) or rice?
Mamaka's offers a modern/hipster/Westernized take on Greek cuisine. The food is not authentic Greek food but rather spin offs with interesting tastes and insta-worthy presentations....but that's what you're overpaying for. The octopus was delicious and the chicken was probably the best bang for your buck. If you're familiar with mountain tea, do yourself a favour and try their cocktail. Overall, cute drinks-only/date atmosphere. Special props for the karaggiozi mural!
This place is awesome. \n\nHad a client visiting the city and wanted to go for a late dinner. \n\nOur options were limited as it was 9pm on a Tuesday night. I knew this place was new and who doesn't like Greek food?\n\nWe walked in and the sous chef immediately informed us that the kitchen had just closed.. (Yet they still had half of the restaurant filled with people) Took a bit of charm on our end and he told us he's re-open the kitchen for us! \n\nNot only that, he made us special lamb chops and truffle fries. Which were both delicious! \n\nThe manager came by for a quick chat and made us feel welcome, the waitress was all smiles and seemed like she loved what she does. \n\nAfter our meal we obviously had to leave a larger than normal gratuity for all their hospitality, the chef came and gave us his card and told us to let him know anytime we wanted to return or have anything catered.  \n\nHappy employees and good customer service really made this a stellar dining experience. Keep it up! \n\nDefinitely going to be returning with more people.
Meh. He food was okay. I was not super impressed by the vegetarian options. The cocktails are fantastic, the service is impeccable, and the spanikopita can't be beat. \n\nWife ordered the beef dish and was unable to finish it due to the \"off\" taste. \n\nGo for cocktails!
This is a glowing review - because the place is whitewashed, brightly lit, and sparkly.\n\nThis adds to the vibrant ambiance, where everyone is having as much fun as you. On the three axes, Mamakas wins - service is on point despite being busy, the food (small plates anyway) were fresh, tasty, and seemingly authentic. The drink selection was appropriate, and the ouzo is affordable and rounds out the experience.\n\nWe're at a shortage of great Greek places in the west.... this is a welcome addition.
I love everything about this restaurant. Food was flawless, and service was great with our server making excellent recommendations. I felt my glass of wine was great value. Will definitely be back!
My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time a couple of weeks ago and we had a fantastic experience. We ordered 2 appetizers (the spanakopita and the cheese saganaki), 2 mains (sheftalia and paidakia), a side of handcut potatoes and the baklava for dessert. The spanakopita was so nice and crispy on the outside and the yogurt at the bottom paired very well with it. The lamb chops were very tender and well seasoned. Although, my favourite was definitely the baklava with the milk and honey ice cream! Lastly, our waiter was great and brought out our food at a good time. I recommend this place for a date night or a birthday!
Great experience, great food and ambiance. Food is light, great tasting and flavourful.  Friendly staff.
I really wanted to like this place, a great looking, casual... friendly space in a great neighbourhood, but the food, it always come down to the food.  \n\nBefore I begin, we were explained to that this is a family style dinner, much like you'd get in a Greek family home. Well, since I grew up around Greek families then it should be familiar and amazing! Looking at the menu, I noticed the prices to be quite high, starters for $12-$18 and mains from $22-$32, and two salads from $14-$18. However, they were apparently large enough to share... not really. The salad arrived and it was barely enough for 1 person, literally 4 bites and it was gone, $14 worth of lettuce and mint? The meatball appetizer came with 5 bite size balls, sitting on a slither of humous, barely Greek family style... humous is not delicate, put more in there please. Our main was the veal eggplant dish, I couldn't find much veal in there... maybe a few bits, my Greek baba's would be yelling at this chef by now. And finally the spanakopita came, it looked incredible, super creative presentation.. too bad it tasted like oven metal, isn't that sad? You must cure the ovenware! I was really hoping it would pull through, but no. \n\nWe decided not to order anything else at this point, and we were not even full... imagine leaving a Greek family dinner hungry??? It's a sin, so was $120 for the meal I described above, with only one glass of wine and a beer.  At least the service was good, friendly smiles from start to end, however sad to say I won't be returning.
A great place to enjoy a selection of greek food. The small, flavourful dishes are great to share and the atmosphere is lively. \n\nMy girlfriend and I shared 4 appetizer dishes and it was plenty. The spanakopita was fluffy, tangy and the added thyme finished it really well. The eggplant dish had amazing combination of flavours; dill, oregano and fried onions somehow all worked together. The lamb pitas were perfectly cooked with the lamb juices still coming out when biting into the pita which is sized to easily fit in your hand without making it awkward.\n\nThe service was really great. We aren't very adept to Greek dishes so the server was able to steer us in the right direction. \n\nThe only concern with the restaurant overall is price. But when you add the positives of the restaurant you know what you're paying for.
YUMMY! I was here in February for a friend's birthday. She had organized a fixed sharing menu for the group - I highly recommend as the staff was very accommodating and attentive.\n\nWe had dips and super soft pita, spanakopita, octopus, tomato salad, lamb chops with tabouli and tzatziki, spicy potatoes and assorted ice cream and cookies for dessert.\n\nI can't find a fault with the meal. The lamb chops were the star, I loved the smokey meat paired with creamy tzatziki and some acid from the tabouli. I could have eaten the platter. Spanakopita was also an impressive version, very flaky pastry and a savoury salty filling. \n\nThe atmosphere was also really fun and lively, I'm going to go back this summer and pretend I'm in Greece.
Started off with their house dips Melitzanosalata and kopanisti which came with soft house made pita breads and the Patates (Greek fries). Amazing starter. For our second course we ordered cheese saganaki, Moussaka, Horiatiki and keftedes, the Presimmon was pre grilled to perfection, and the humus with parsley puree stole the show. Finally we completed our meal with brined chicken  let me tell you the lemon butter sauce is amazing. Cocktails karida was amazing. Ambiance is amazing friendly staff would definitely go back.
For the food that we received and the price that we paid, we definitely DID NOT get our money's worth!!! Service was great and the atmosphere was ok but i mean lets be honest when we all go out to eat at a restaurant because we are hungry, we expect to at least get full after paying more than $100. \nMy husband and I will definitely never go back. We will stick to greek town!
I've been hearing about Mamakas for about a year now, mainly from a friend who couldn't stop singing its praises. I finally had an opportunity to check it out and I have to say I wasn't let down at all.  We arrive and are seated immediately, even though we haven't had any reservations.  I would recommend making reservations though, they filled up pretty quickly on the Monday night. \n\nOur server was lovely, and informative.  I mentioned it was my first time here and she made suggestions on what and how many of each course to order. She also recommended a Metaxa Mule as I like cocktails that aren't too sweet. \n\nAs per the norm, we ordered waaay too much for just two people and all the food arrived promptly - in fact the only complaint I really have is that the food arrived pretty much all at the same time and we felt a bit rushed to eat it all (I know, it's tragic), but our server did apologize a couple times. \n\nThe food here is meant to be shared, so order a few dishes and family style it. \n\nMust order:\nLamb - Perfectly cooked, if you enjoy lamb rare to mid-rare, melts in your mouth, and sits on a bed of tzaiki and bulgar. \n\nOctopus - tender pieces of tentacle served with pickled onions and capers. My fav octopus in the city thus far. \n\nDips - I only tried two of the four listed - the Taramousalata, fish based dip that has the texture of mousse, it was very light and tasty, and the Kopanisti which is feta with roasted red pepper. It's a little coarser than the first dip but just as good. It's served with the most amazing, freshly baked pita bread. I could sit there and eat bread and dip all day.\n\nThe only dish I didn't enjoy as much was the eggplant dish. I found a bit under seasoned for my tastes. \n\nThoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish (their desserts are divine!) and would return in a heartbeat.
I have wanted to try Mamakas for a reallyyyyy long time - I liked the idea of a Greek restaurant not on the saturated Danforth area. \n\nWhen making resos online, Open Table told me there were only bar or high top tables available. Since I like a back to my seat, I chose the high top tables which were nice and intimate for two.\n\nLove the interior, it's nice, cozy and all white for a dark and cold wintery night. I am going to say this now, and will repeat it later...they are EFFICIENT here! Plates come out one after another and we were done our apps and mains in 40 minutes. \n\nPlease order one of the dips as it comes with warm and oh so yummy house-made pita bread. We got the eggplant dip and it was delish. With a bit of sweet honey, everything about this app was appetizing. Unfortunately, the night we were there, the resto had no more smelts for the night. We tried the fried meatballs which were ok.\n\nFor two, my husband and I decided to share the fresh fish which was grilled to perfection. The meat was tender and with good EVOO, the simple, but great flavors really hit the spot. Plates are meant to be shared so for two, the fish was enough plus a side.\n\nDesserts are your usual Baklava and sweet desserts.\n\nService was great. Wine list all Greek which I love - it gives you a chance to try Greek wines. I ordered two glasses of a Gaia (categorized under the Lighter Red) and it was delish.\n\nOverall, highly recommend Mamakas. It is great Greek Food, service and ambiance.
I have eaten here five times and there is nothing I don't like. I am not really even into Greek food. Great atmosphere and cool vibe for a date.
My initial assumption about this place is that the food was going to be fancier souvalaki-like dishes drenched in tzatziki sauce. Boy am I wrong. This place really sets themselves apart from the flavours and nice sophisticated ambiance without the uptight feel. This is Family-style so you can share the dishes and try a bit of each. The waitress is knowledgeable but I felt like we were a little rushed to get out as they cleared the plates when there was still a little bit of food left. \n\nThe must try: \nPaidakia (lambchops) and halloumi (appetizer with corn peaches pistachio and cheese). The house dips are are also good. I like the eggplant based and also the spicy dip one.\n\nNot as good:\nChicken was a little on the dry side. \nFish was just steamed fish not that special \nOctopus has an interesting sauce, good to try but it wasn't cooked that perfectly.
Food was great and ample. All 3 sides (fries, dandelion salad, red peppers) were amazing.  Service was good and we were seated right away on a Sunday night without reservations, but did get the sense we'd lucked out since it was soon packed thereafter. Ambience is great with cool white decor and good energy. Definitely a place for eating with friends. As locals we're happy to see this addition to the Ossington strip.
I was looking for Greek food but didn't want all the kitsch of Danforth Ave. I stumbled upon a review of this place and was hooked as soon as I saw the menu. \nThe restaurant decor is clean, warm, and modern with subtle hints of the Mediterranean. \n\n The food was outstanding. The fresh baked bread covered  in fresh and dried herbs, drizzled with olive oil were amazing fresh out of the oven. Fried smelts were salty, crunchy, addictive. Couldn't stop eating them. We also had the lamb, octopus, braised rabbit, and squash fondue. All delicious but the lamb was my favorite. Baklava dessert was kind of a miss. The phyllo had gotten soggy but the milk and honey ice cream was spot on. \n\nI would definitely come back here again if I am back in Toronto.
In my view, there are 3 components to a successful restaurant meal:  the food, the decor/ambiance, and the service.  There are 10,000 restaurants in Toronto and if a place doesn't satisfy all three parts, then as far as I'm concerned, there are 9,999 restaurants left to try and I won't give a place a second chance.  Unfortunately Mamakas Taverna falls into that category.\n\nLet's start with the good:  the food was quite good.  We started with a few dips, spanakopita and saganaki.  The saganaki was so delicious with a honey taste that we ordered a 2nd.  Cheese fries are not to be missed, flavoured with truffle oil.  Lamb chops were a little on the small side, and red snapper was both overcooked and overpriced at $55.\n\nThe place is loud but in a good way - lots of energy.\n\nNow for the most important part:  the food was good enough for 3 stars however I rated Mamakas  as 1 star for their arrogance and rudeness.  I need to mention that our server was very friendly and polite.  If only she also worked the front of the restaurant as well....\n\nFull disclosure:  we were approximately 10 minutes late for our 7:45 reservation.  We received a call in the car at 7:46 to confirm that we were still coming.  We mentioned that we were 5 minutes away and would be there shortly.  The hostess told us that she could only hold the table until 8:00 and we reassured her that we would be there before that time.  She then told us that at one minute after 8:00 our table would be gone.  Seriously?   Who chastises their customers like that?  We should have been tipped off as to what to expect at that point.  I might add that when we checked in at 7:55 we were told our table would be ready in a moment- they were just setting it.  When we were seated we were told that they have a strict policy of a two hour time limit for dining.\n\nOur meal came out well paced, though the sides arrived well after we started the entrees and were removed from the bill.  At 10:01 the hostess came to our table to figuratively remind us that our \"meter had expired\", and that the group waiting for our table had been standing at the front for 15 minutes.  She said we were welcome to stay and finish our conversation at the bar, but we would have to vacate the table immediately.\n\nThis uncomfortable situation could easily have been avoided.  Most importantly they should let people know about their time limit when they make their reservation.  I just spoke with Carbon Bar to make a reservation and they told me they had a similar policy and I thanked them for letting me know and booked elsewhere.  Alternatively, if the hostess had offered to buy a round of drinks for our inconvenience it would have gone a long way.  But nothing but rudeness and arrogance.\n\nSuffice it to say, there are now 9,999 restaurants in Toronto and I will NOT be going back to find out if they are any friendlier.
Excellent food and great service. Everything we had - the taramosalata, mussels, octopus, horiatiki salad, sweetbreads, lamb, sea bass carpaccio and dessert - was perfectly cooked and amazing!\n\nThe place is really cute and has a great vibe and buzz. Will definitely go back. :)
Greek restaurants are one of my favourites. \nThis place does a great disservice to that love.\nGood food in dismal  portions. Bad service in large servings !!
Un service parfait.\nDe la nourriture authentique.\nUne ambiance agr\u00e9able.\nLes prix sont raisonnables.\n\nNous avons partag\u00e9 :\n- House dip (tzatziki avec pain grec)\n- Spanakopita\n- Asperges au citron\n- salade grecque\n- vin rouge grecque\n- baklava\n- caf\u00e9 grec\n\nTotal incluant taxes et service = 150$\n\nPortions plus que suffisantes.\nTous nos plats \u00e9taient savoureux.\n\nUn sans faute.
A fairly upscale Greek place, with some decent cocktails, absurd little fried fish, tasty-but-uneven octopus, very tender lamb chops, and excellent appetizer dips.\n\nThe server suggested doing things family-style --- order a plate of chops for the table, not as a meal for yourself.  This worked well --- one person ran a little short of bread with the dips, but everything split up into four chunks well.\n\nDrink-wise, I tried the \"Mov\" --- gin, egg white, blueberry shrub, lemon, and a few other things.  Nicely frilly and frothy, which is what I was looking for.\n\nThe \"Atherina\" fried smelts were delicious --- sort of an rich, oily, fishy version of popcorn shrimp.\n\nThe \"Oktap\u00f3di\" octopus was a little uneven --- my quarter was delicious, but some of the other legs came out a little dry.\n\nDessert-wise, the \"Galaktoboureko\" was more airy and less chocolatey than expected, but tasty.  The milk-and-honey icecream had a great flavor, and fine (though slightly icey) texture.\n\nExcellent service.\n\nHaving a reservation helped significantly on a Thursday evening.
Easily the best meal I've had in Toronto. \n\nWent with a group of 3 to celebrate my birthday and was totally blown away by the freshness and quality of the food. I am Greek so am very familiar with the cuisine and highly recommend dining at this restaurant. \n\nThe decor is lovely, the service attentive and helpful, the menu varied and enticing. \n\nWe started with the tzatziki, melitzanosalata, halloumi, and fried smelts. Each dish was perfectly seasoned and the freshness and quality of the smelts was outstanding. \n\nFor the main course, we shared the fish of the day (beautifully fresh grilled sea bream), the squash fondue, and the beef cheek stifado. \n\nPut simply, this restaurant showcases the best of Greek cuisine: fresh, high quality ingredients seasoned simply to highlight their natural taste. It's a pricy meal but well worth it. \n\nI can't understand the inconsistent reviews on Yelp- I can't recommend this place more highly.
Mamakas is still excellent.\n\nIt is no less noisy!\n\nStill pay attention to seating when reserving.\n\nThe fish is  superb. (We had sea bream).\n\nWe drank Kidonistalata which was great, crisp and minerally. ($55)\n\nThe lamb chops were delicious.\n\nStill clearly a recommendable place to try.
Giving this place just two stars, for now, but I think it has the potential to be very good. \n\nWent as a group of 4. We were very excited to try it out as we had watched the construction for a long time. Was very busy but the atmosphere was great and the food smelled amazing. Sat at our table at the back and picked the cheap, $39, bottle of sauvignon blanc. Waiter told us he hated it and it was horrible. Suggested either a $50 or $80 bottle instead. Nice try. \n\nAs for food, guess we didn't realize it was share plates but ordered some appetizers and a few mains. Server kept saying we needed more and that we had to have some salad that he never ended up bringing. Fish main was sold out and there was no other veggie non shellfish option. Appetizers were generally $12-$16 but were very small. Half an eggplant with some onion on top and a half slice of toast was like $16. Waiter told us we would have to pay for more bread, but graciously brought us another have slice even though he wasn't supposed to. What a rogue! Eggplant tasted good. Saganaki was very good. Mains were also excellent. Waiter was inattentive because he seemed preoccupied with a large group who would yield a bigger tip. With better service and more value, this place would be awesome. \n\nTl;dr delicious food and good atmosphere hampered by poor service and mediocre value.
Best Greek food in Toronto. Focusing on seasonal ingredients, the chefs create inventive versions of classic Greek dishes like horitaki salad, saganaki, spanakopita. Lamb chops and sea bass were grilled to perfection. Enjoyed a really unusual but tasty ricotta cheesecake with rhubarb and sesame. Delicious! They also offer an extensive list of Greek wines. The service is excellent -- efficient and attentive. I have already made another reservation for a return visit next week. The place is busy, so reservations are recommended.
Food was tasty and high quality but was small portioned. We had ordered a tamasalata dip, lamp shank specially wrapped in parchment paper and a grilled octopus tentacle. Our server was very knowledgeable but she was the exception as the other staff were very uninformed about the food and provided little to no interest in recommendations otherwise. \n\nAtmosphere was good,  saw a few dates taking place but personally found to talk as the room itself amplified noise.\n\nPart of what made this experience undesirable was because we were not given the option the even have tap water. We were pretty much forced to be charged for having still water. Additionally we were never informed that we'd be charged for asking for additionally pita when the 4 small pieces were insufficient for the dip we ordered.
This place, along with Estiatorio Volos, are jointly carrying the Greek cuisine crowns in Toronto. \n\nUnlike Volos, Mamakas is pleasantly more casual, which is why it's great for a meal with your significant other or with a small group of friends, too.\n\nThe menu is delicious on the whole. Keeping it honest, I'm less crazy about their brunch. The brunch was perfectly fine, but had brunch been my only experience at Mamakas, I wouldn't be excitedly hurrying back. With that said, dinner is fantastic, and they have some interesting and tasty cocktails, too. Their food is authentic enough for a taste of Greece, but also slightly modernized for some unique flavors, too.\n\nThe servers are friendly and great, too. \n\nHighly recommended!
A trendy, signature Ossington vibe with a Mediterranean twist. The open-kitchen concept is something that I've come to truly appreciate. The food was a nice balance between contemporary flair with traditional Greek twists. The menu boats quite a few Greek classics and a few \"Greek-fusion\" selections. We opted to start with the lamb tartare and the fried smelts. The lamb was very fresh and tender, with a rich yogurt-based garlic sauce, lemon, onion and celery. It was delicious but the flavour of the meat was a little lost in all the seasoning. It was also uncharacteristically spicy. The smelts were delicious, fresh and crisp, a dish that really brought back memories from the Aegean. Our mains were the grilled octopus and the Ontario lamb chops. The grilled octopus was flavourful, tender and perfectly cooked. This tends to be a difficult dish to execute, it's easy to overcook which results in a rubbery texture. The lamb was also spot-on, tender and juicy. It was presented beautifully and was served with a well-balanced in-house tzatziki sauce. We also ordered a side of dandelion and spinach saut\u00e9ed with garlic, olive oil and rhubarb - very tasty. Overall I was very happy with my experience at Mamakas. Don't expect a traditional Greek taverna with old-school dishes and huge portions, but a modern Greek-inspired menu that's using some interesting local ingredients.
Exceptionally satisfied after our meal at Mamakas Taverna. Nice addition to Ossington. The restaurant was full so we took a seat at the stools overlooking the kitchen - which I personally love because you get to watch the talented chefs do their thing. Everything that left that kitchen was presented perfectly and looked delicious. We ended up having the tzatziki, fried artichokes, grilled octopus with a fava puree, sauteed green beans and the roasted free-range chicken, glazed with honey and lemon thyme. We witnessed the chef carefully glaze the chicken several times and when we were presented with the dish, we were very pleased with the flavour and nice crisp of the skin. Must try the whole fish on my next visit. My only disappointment of the night was my cocktail - but hey, I was there for the food!\n\nIf you have the patience to wait in line, check out Bang Bang Ice Cream across the street.
Opa! \n\nI've been scheming a nice new restaurant to try for a special occasion, and Mamakas was at the top of my list. I've never come across high-end Greek food in Toronto, so I was pretty excited. I love Greek food, I love fancy things, win win. \n\nThe restaurant itself is sparkling white with bright murals and large windows for Ossington people watching, one of my favourite sports. While sitting in this bustling yet pristine setting, we enjoyed their tequila negroni, the tzaziki and pita, the spanikopita, the lamb and the octopus. It was all delicious, especially the tzaziki and lamb. The octopus is huge and means business, so if you're like Neil Patrick Harris* and are into octopus and scrabble, this is probably your dish. The owner sent over a small bottle of ouzo, which really added a kick to our night, and was very appreciated. \n\nPEPPER'S PISSED: Huh. Haven't been pissed in a while, but I need to sound off. What is with this new airplane-sized bathroom trend, Tarana? I'd rather wait for a couple of minutes than be squished into a 2x2 room that houses a sink, toilet, mirror and garbage. \n\n*I just saw Gone Girl.
Went to Mamakas on the recommendation of my Greek coworker for a friend's birthday dinner. Quick run-down:\n\n- great service, attentive but not over-bearing\n- great modern twist on classic Greek fare\n- cute venue with interesting art, good for a date night\n- would definitely go back\n- $$$\n\nI went here with a group. There was 8 of us and everyone loved their food. We pretty much ended up all sharing because it was all so good.\n\nI'll start with what I ordered, which was the stifado (braised beef cheek). Holy crap this was amazing! The meat was so tender and whatever they marinated the meat in, it was superb. It came on a bed of what I think was potato puree with some sort of glaze drizzled on the meat and the puree. Onion, sunchokes and a few roasted baby potatoes. The dish looks rather small when it comes out, but the meat is surprisingly filling and I was at a good point when I finished. Perfectly content.\n\nI also tried the mousakas, spanikopita (probably my second favourite dish), and the pork belly gyro. All were fantastic dishes. We got a few orders of the house dips, which came with freshly baked bread that was amazing on its own. Our waiter messed up and gave us an extra dip, we let him know and he let us have it for free. We also had their dark chocolate & tahini icecream. It was a very interesting combo. First bite, I thought \"ehhhh\" second bite, \"okay, okay this is interesting\" third bite \"yeah, I like this\" it has an almost peanut buttery taste that is slightly salty but decidedly good.\n\nOne of my friends has a pretty severe nut allergy and when we told our server he pointed out the dishes that didn't contain any nuts and when he brought the dessert menu he did the same thing. Which was very helpful.\n\nI love Greek food and have been to a number of Greek restaurants on the Danforth that were on point and I would say this restaurant stacks up really well against them. I would also recommend making a reservation. We went on a Wednesday evening for 7:30 and the restaurant quickly filled up.\n\nFinal answer, I would most definitely go back. That braised beef cheek.... **sigh
What a delicious take on Greek cuisine. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, you feel like you are being welcomed into someone's home. We really appreciate the vibe of the place, the uniforms and the style of eating. I took my parents there (who aren't big into fancy food) and it was an approachable and enjoyable experience. The food was delicious as well!
Great fun and bright atmosphere. Came with 3 girlfriends, all with various food allergies (vegetarian, lactose, gluten-free). We each found several options for us on the menu, but best of all, is probably the extensive cocktail list!! (pricey at $14 a pop, however). Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about all items on the menu and provided us with sound guidance as we made our choices. \n\nThe spanikopita is seriously like crack. There is a honey drizzle that provides a lovely addition.\nThe octopus was much better than any of the \"trendy octopus\" dishes served by many of Toronto's west-end restaurants. \nWe had a bunch of other things -- the eggplant appetizer dish was quite meaty for a veg option; fairly heavy. \n\nOverall, excellent service and atmosphere.
I am not the type of person to go online and write reviews about restaurants but I felt compelled to do so.\n\nMy boyfriend and I arrived at Mamakas with great anticipation as we have been wanting to try them out for over a year.  This was suppose to be a special night for us, celebrating our anniversary but it turned out to be one of the worst dinning experiences we've ever endured.\n\n1.) Service: HORRIBLE. I was confused about the wines as I am not too familiar with greek wines. Our server was not only condescending but also very rude. As I made my final decision she walked away, rolling her eyes with a half smirk. I was appalled. This set the tone for the entire night as she was rude and short with us throughout service.\n\n2.) FOOD: Our appetizers and salad were fantastic. Beautiful olive oil used and simplicity of the dish. When our mains came, we were in anticipation of two of our favourites. Octopus and lamb chops.\n\nAfter taking one bite of the lamb chop, I almost gagged. It was like they had dumped the entire bottle of salt on these chops. They were so over the top salty that they were inedible.\nI requested for them to be sent back. Our server said they would re fire them not problem as this was their house specialty. Within 1 minute they were returned. How are new lamb chops re-fired and brought back within 1 minute? There were two lamb chops that were returned to us and tasted the EXACT same. Did they just scrape the top off? I was disguised. \n\nThe same goes for the octopus. It was SO over the top over seasoned that it was just painful trying to eat it. I've been to countless greek restaurants and travelled greece for months and the food is no where this over seasoned. \n\nI am not only appalled by this restaurant but coming from years of working in the hospitality industry myself, I would never treat customers the way my server did. This whole dinning experience ruined a beautiful night we were suppose to have.\n\nDisgusted.
This is definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in Toronto hands down and far, far away from the Danforth so hold your OPAs. Delicious, modern takes on classic Greek dishes set in the hip and trendy Ossington area. I'd highly suggest the Sunday lunch. They offer smaller portions of their regular dinner menu and it's not as busy. Great service. I'd say this is mid-range + in terms of price. I don't know who is complaining about portions because we left stuffed and very happy.\n\n---Spanakopita: Outstanding spinach filled phyllo topped with honey and set on a bed of delicious greek yogurt. Tangy, sweet and rich. Three more please.\n---Halloumi: Would have preferred the cheese to be a bit warmer but with the squash, apple and pecan compote/puree underneath, it was a great marriage\n---Tiganites Patates: Pretty spectacular. Umami\n---Calamari: Served with fried chickpeas and chickpea puree. This was just okay for me.\n\nGreat cappuccinos and cocktails. $2 sparkling water. Can't go wrong.
Like the decor and cool vibe but have to say I don't mind paying $30 for fresh catch of the day.. But the cod was anything but fresh .\nThe spinach pastry apps were actually awesome as was the service. \nMy dinner mate had his dish comped given kitchen admission that marinade was off.\nNot sure I'll give it another go.. I like the food diversity avail on the strip and nice to have the Greek option but ultimately felt like an overpriced offering . The food Definately feel short !
The atmosphere is cute-charming casual and up beat.  I would not say it is elegant.  The open kitchen is in the front as soon as you walk in.  A long marble bar occupies the middle of the restaurant.  I am not fooled into thinking that the cheap cinder block walls painted white are similar to Greek stucco.  In my opinion, this is a great place for a first date since I saw a lot of first date couples there on a Friday night and there were no children.  Be aware that all the cocktails on the Cocktail Menu contain simple syrup, except for one which is Sherry based.  The Greek wine was fine.  We ordered three food items.  First, if you like cheese on your Tuna Tartare (I don't) then this is the place for you.  Their Greek touch is topping tuna tartare with Feta Cheese.  Next, we got the steamed Muscles.  They are grotesquely huge!!! They are so big that one must use a knife and fork to cut in half because one whole in your mouth is like size of a golf ball.  Try 8 cm long (or 3 inches long) and wide!! \nFinally, we ordered the octopus, $20.  It was just the one arm, just like every other restaurant does here in Toronto.  This arm was huge too!!  But it was tender sweet and without any fat.  Service was good and attentive.  With so many other restaurants in the city, I don't know if I would give it another try.  I did not walk away feeling excited.
We have a winner on our hand here folks. I have seen this place crop up without much fan fare then I started to see the crowds gather and was more intrigued how the food was here. \nThis was an unplanned visit as was in the area. We had time to kill so came in and looked at the menu and decided to visit this spot after looking at the menu (should have checked what's available as well more on than later)\nI enjoy Greek cuisine and was thinking to try out the classics to get a better idea on where they stand. My DC wanted to have chicken and found out later that was it wasn't being sold that day. Anyway here is what we ordered \nHaloomi: Hit it out of park just gorgeous presentation and with a nice balance of citrus and carrot puree. Fried just right and was quite fresh too I think as its unlike the store bought version I am used too.\nSpanakopita : Done very well again. Very rich as expected and I recommend it sharing among 3-4 people if having mains.\nOctopus: I use this as a yardstick for Greek food along with the lavraki to asses the kitchen skills on seafood. Hmm this was OK not great. While charred nicely it was a bit more chewy than I would expect at a place that does other dishes so well.\nMoussaka (vegetarian): Oh boy this is the highlight of the dishes I tried on this visit. Just gorgeous as it is just so hard to elevate a vegetable dish let alone make it stand out this way over a cuisine which is mainly known for their meats. This is the best Moussaka I have ever had. Gorgeous perfectly cooked vegetables cut paper thin and layer upon layer of flavor. Bechamel topping the dish was also done just right. I will be back just to try this out.\nPotatos side was forgetful. \nWine list as expected is mainly Greek wines and are reasonably priced with good options by the glass. \nThe place gets crowded real fast as seemed like many of them were regulars so I would recommend making a reservations even on weekdays. I think this by far one of the best Greek food spots in Toronto! I will be back to try out the other classics\n4.5 stars!
Amazing food! Got our meal very quickly. The lamb chops are to die for. Octopus was good as well! The energy and the chefs are amazing! We loved the decor and music. Definitely coming back
Greek food experience at its best! Tzatziki and tirramosalata with pita are great starters. The pita is the best I've ever had. Order the spinakopita, chicken and horatiki salad. We paired our meal with a bottle of Malamatina (retsina). Atmosphere is lovely and the service was terrific.
The place itself is very clean, modern but still very recognizably Greek feel to it.  \n\nThe staff were great and our waitress was exceptional. You don't say that too often in Toronto especially on a busy Saturday night dinner service. \nThe food has been getting rave reviews and while everything we tried was good to very good I would not classify anything as over the top. There is one exception. The dandelion greens were better than even my mamas. \n\nAs a group of 4 we decided we would each order a appetizer and main each along with the village salad and two sides to share between us.  \n\nAppetizers:\nBread & olive oil - meh!  This should be offered complimentary. \nTaramasalata - silky, creamy good. \nSmelts - grilled nicely. \nCroquettes - not traditional at all but a really nice Greek twist served with red pepper sauce. Could have/should have ordered a 2nd order. \n\nMains:\nGrilled fish - tasty and cooked well but nothing over the top. \nOctopus - grilled well but served with a bean pur\u00e9e that was gritty almost chalky. \nPork - very nicely cooked. The mustard seeds added a nice pop of flavour. \nLamb - yum. One of the few thing I wanted more of. \n\nSide:\nGreens - as previously mention they were exceptional. I didn't want to share.\nVillage salad - meh!  It's tomatoes with feta. Maybe I'm spoiled having fresh tomatoes from my mothers garden all summer. \nPotatoes - they're French fries with feta. Meh! \n\nDesserts:\nBaklava - don't bother. I found it very dry and overly stuffed with nuts. The vanilla honey ice cream was great. \nPear cake - yum!  Could have had a second. \n\nPrice - is moderate. Dinner for 4 with drinks came out to $200. That's pretty average for a nice night out. \n\nOverall this is a very nice place to go for non traditional Greek food. I don't even like calling it Greek food. It's good Mediterranean food. It's not the stereotypical \"fast food\" you find on the Danforth loaded with rice and potatoes.
We were in the PHX area and and my friend Douglas invited us to check out his home.  We were meeting in the morning and he suggested we have breakfast and that he had a good place to meet.  We were not sure what to expect...Dennys or something but when he told us where we were pleasantly surprised.  \n\nThe food we had was very good.  The wife and I shared a Santa Fe scramble and French Toast.  Both were very good.  The Cinnamon bread was thick and very good and fresh and the skillet was a good spicy.    As he mentioned to his wife we were plate cleaners and must have liked the place.  \n\nIt was clean and nicely decorated and like the old-time light bulbs.\n\nI would definitely go back the next time we are in the PHX area.
Everything I have eaten here is excellent not to mention, they offer the BEST Eggs Benedict EVER MADE!  I love this family owned restaurant and have been going for years.  I especially love their new decor and light fixtures, it gives the restaurant a great country feel inside.
Great service! Great food! Restaurant set up is smooth and flowing well even when packed!
T. C. Eggington's.  We found this place with my iPhone one morning while looking for brunch.  The ratings were good, so we decided to give them a try.\n\nWe walked in and had kind of a U. S. Egg experience: no sooner did we enter than FIVE consistently dressed and made-up women (some in shorts, some with blond hair, and ALL in pink-dominated pastels) turned their heads to greet us in a Stepford fashion.  One led us to a table in the back of the restaurant.  The surreal combination of this, menus with chicken wire inset into them, a long table next to us filled with 60-plus diners, and \"Like a Fool Believes\" playing over the restaurant speakers had me in a fit of uncontrollable laughter.\n\nThe menu was so full of puns like \"hens forth\", and \"egg cetera\" that I was almost too distracted to order my food.  However, I did settle on a stack of pancakes and sharing an order of french toast with my wife.\n\nFrankly, I thought they only served pancakes THIS BIG at truck stops out around Kingman.  These things are gigantic.  Taste?  Best I've had in a restaurant--and I've had lots of pancakes in restaurants.  Order a stack here, and you'll have enough breakfast for two to three days afterwards--getting your money's worth is always a good thing.  Same for the French Toast--big portions, WOW taste.\n\nThis is the place you bring visitors from out of town when you want  to take them to have breakfast or brunch out.  The next morning, you can have breakfast or brunch IN, with the same food.\n\nT. C. Eggington's is the ultimate breakfast joint in the Valley.  Go.  Just. . .go.
Best breakfast spot in town. Their English muffins and jam are out of this world. The Crack O' Dawn plate is my favorite; however, the English muffins and their homemade jams are what keep me coming back.
What a delicious, delightful surprise! Our Scottsdale friends kept telling us we'd be having breakfast at their favorite restaurant, T.C. Eggington's, and now I know why they saved it for our last morning. Nothing else compares! \n\nClean, cute cafe atmosphere (I loved the chicken wire on the menu!), a huge menu of possibilities (all unusual and yummy sounding), good service and home-baked goodness down to the English muffin. \n\nI ordered the O'Pear Grenache Omelette based on recommendations from my friends AND the waiter. Here's the description: \"How sweet it is...A subtle mix of bosc pear slices, melted Havarti cheese, sliced almonds  and bacon offer you an extraordinary rich flavor you're never experienced.\"\n\nThey were right. And it was SO HUGE that I couldn't finish it...though I really wanted to! (Next time, I'll order the \"reduced\" size - two instead of three eggs. I didn't know I could...or that I should!)\n\nEveryone at the table was happy with their order. My only regret is that I don't live close enough to try all of their omelettes...
Been here 2 times already for breakfast and this is by far my favorite place to come. Homemade waffles are the best I've ever had in Phoenix. Their homemade apple cinnamon jelly is perfect! Great service and very friendly people. Will always keep coming back here. Only complaint is that it is on the expensive side for me but food is amaZing.
I've been here several times and really enjoy the food. The service can be a little slow at times though.
Today was the first day I've been to this restaurant. A couple of my friends and I stopped in for breakfast. Probably one of the best eggs Benedict plates I've ever had. Our server was very kind and did a wonderful job. I would recommend this food to both varieties of guests, those looking for a healthy light meal (they offer gluten free) as well as those looking for the delicious desert style waffles. Wish I could add another star!!
I'm preety sure this place is family owned which means decent prices and friendly staff. The problem is we seem to get waiters that are inexperienced and can forget about things from time to time. But that is nitpicking the food here is great. I have had maybe 6 to 7 different things on the menu and all of them were exactly as advertised and very good. I usually stick to the farmers Benedict which is nice and fresh. My wife enjoys their omelets and pancakes. Check out the jam on the table it is very scrumprious. Nothing crazy here just really solid American  breakfast fair.
Highly disappointed with the service. Luckily found out that they serve brown water for coffee as they serve it out front while you wait so didn't order it inside. I've had better coffee at gas stations, sadly.  My daughters poached egg came out nearly raw & when I kindly asked the waiter to have the kitchen cook it through, he acted like \"of course, no problem\" but then 10 mins later brought us an equally-- if not more-- raw egg. As a former server, I would have been embarrassed to serve it-- I mean the yolk was completely yellow, it wasn't a subtle thing. .  When my husband pointed out-- again, that the egg looked just as raw, & asked for a fully cooked egg,  the waiter stated arrogantly, \"Well, *That's* a poached egg\".  We don't work at a breakfast place, but my husband & I have both worked in nice restaurants. If there is a standard as to how poached eggs are cooked, that should have been explained either at the time of ordering, or at least after it was sent back the first time. We gladly would have changed the order to an over hard egg if the chef was too arrogant to fully cook a poached egg.  After the egg went back the 2nd time, it took at least 15 minutes for it to come back. Everyone else in our party of 8 was done eating and I asked the waiter to just box it up, at this point it was clear I was upset.  \n\nSome restaurants send a manager over at the first sign of trouble. Most would certainly do it after the 2nd time an order gets returned to the kitchen.  Even after I was clearly upset (& yes, he knew, cause he tried not to hand the check to me & I could see his dismay when I took it) no manager came to rectify the situation and we had to pay for a meal that was never eaten   (we took it home out of principal, but I doubt at this point it will get eaten..)   I really should have asked to see a manager, but I didn't want to make our guests more uncomfortable, which is why most restaurants take the burden off the customer & automatically have mgr's come to talk to a table when there has been a problem. It is rare that I take grievances out on a servers tip, being a former server myself, but he was so clearly apathetic to the situation that I left him slightly less than 15% when I am normally a 20-25% tipper. You would think that after spending nearly $100 on breakfast (we were ordering mimosas and bloody Mary's etc...) the server would have cared a little more about his service. I guess TC Eggingtons rely's on their long standing rep but with service this bad, that balloon will eventually pop.
Little did I know that the thing to do after going to Mass at St. Tim's is breakfast at TC Eggington's...\n\nThat being said, it makes for a crowd and a wait; however, ...TOTALLY WORTH IT! Plus, you can call in and put your name down ahead. This morning I called at 7 this morning for our 10AM breakfast, was bumped to 10:15 (doable), and ended up beating the rush and sneaking in just before 10 anyway.\n\nBreakfast here is delicious. Delicious! We have tried:\n\nHilltop Acres -- excellent combination of veg, skillet style\nCrack o' Dawn -- nicely basted eggs on top (as has the Hilltop Acres)\nThe Eggington Omelet -- hesitated because of the cream cheese inside, but its blend with the chicken, broccoli, and hollandaise is tasty!\nCrab Stuffed Pastry -- perfectly crispy pastry shells full of crab, artichoke hearts, basted eggs, and hollandaise? Yes, please!!\n\nMuch happier waiting for breakfast here than going to any of the other breakfast chains in the area.
I have been coming here for at least 20 years (since I was a little girl!) and even though I now live an hour away, I still drive there for breakfast! Their French toast is the best in the valley (and trust me I have tried at least 20 other breakfast joints). I also love their huevos con chorizo and their eggs Benedict! It really doesn't get any better then this place! As for the wait, yea there always is one BUT, they take reservations over the phone so the wait is nothing if you call ahead.
Love this place. Always the right choice when deciding where to eat for brunch. I can only speak for the benedicts but when i tell you they are Done just right! I know you'll believe me the second you walk in and see the platters served. Do yourself a favor go eat there and see for yourself.
This is a fantastic place for breakfast!! I can't believe I haven't been here before, but I can promise it won't be my last. Love the whole atmosphere and service. Food was excellent.
I appreciated the unique tastes and odd breakfast pairings (asparagus, mushrooms, goat cheese, etc.) on T.C. Eggington's eclectic looking menu, but the variety offered really isn't as extensive as it first appears, service was average at best and the pricing is pretty extreme for what equates to Waffle House quality food with an extra helping of mushrooms and hollandaise sauce thrown on top. Basic entrees and orange juice for 2 individuals = $26...before tip! That's certainly an expensive way to start your day!\n\nThe atmosphere makes it a great place to take family visiting from out of town, which I plan to do, but the price makes it hard to justify as a regular breakfast stop. You can get equivalent food at other local establishments for half the price.
Quite lovely place to have Breakfast/Brunch. The ambiance was warm and fairly quiet. The food was wonderful! They have a great menu with lots of options depending on what you like, should be something for anyone, including the kids. I can also speak very highly of our service, as our server Alex very graciously discussed some of her recommendations with us. Great experience overall! We will be back, maybe tomorrow!
Nice place to have breakfast.  Generally good food and nice ambience.
Been going here since I was a kid, always pleased with the food and service! I always get the Spicy Spain omelette with toast and strawberry jam. YUM!!
I LOVE breakfast food. I will go all over and try tons of places to find the best and in my opinion this is it. Forget about all these other overpriced fancy breakfast places all over the valley....in my opinion its all overly sweet and makes you feel terrible afterwards. T.C Eggington's is SO good and they have a very normal take on breakfast, but they do it they best way possible.
I have tried this place twice now, and it fails to hit the mark.  Everyone else in my party has been happy both times.  However, I seem to be cursed here.  Whatever I order is always loaded with onions.  I absolutely HATE onions, and I avoid ordering anything that contains onions.  Last time I ate here, I asked for no onions in an omelet ith brie cheese that I was pretty excited about, and they left 'em in there.  I was too cowardly to demand that it be returned to the kitchen, I so I just didn't eat it.  Today, I ordered a sandwich which mentioned nothing about onions, and they were all over my food.  Yuck!  I ordered a muffin to mask the taste, and it did the trick.  The muffin was the only good thing I've eaten here.  However, if you like onions, you might love it!
This is a \"good as it gets\" place for me.  i have been going to here since it opened - telling you something about my age and that I tend to like the place.  It is a haunt of faculty and staff and even administrators from Mesa Community College.  A good place to leisurely have conversation over great food.  I am an Eggington Omelette addict so enough said.
Giant portions of really good food. Excellent service. The french toast was so good I dreamt about it afterwards!
There's definitely a Carolinas feel when you go here. Service is very attentive, and portion sizes are on the bigger side. The hollandaise sauce here is good, but could be too oily to some. Get the crab stuffed pastry if you can. \n\nHash browns are okay. It's interesting to see how different breakfast places interpret their hash browns. This place has them slightly textured on the outside, soft in the middle. For me, that's acceptable. \n\nWould encourage revisits. Multiple.
What can I say? We have been coming to T. C. Eggington's for more than 10 years and are still as pleased today as that very first time.\n\nA brunchery, T.C. Eggington's fare is consistantly high quality, tasty and filling. I believe they serve the finest hot cakes to be found anywhere as well as excellent omelets and wonderful salads and sandwiches. Combined with friendly service (a major component in a happy dining experience) and a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nI cannot recommend T. C. Eggingtons highly enough. Please take the time for a nice leisurely visit. Be prepared though, they have such a strong following that there is frequently a wait to be seated even on weekdays, but your patience will be rewarded. Enjoy.
This place means business when it comes to breakfast. The portions are enormous and everything is made using super high quality ingredients. The french toast slicers were as big as my face and the bacon is super thick cut. Any place that serves you see-through floppy meat should not be able to call it bacon!\n\nThe service was average but the food is where it's at! There's this awesome apple cinnamon jelly on the table for your biscuits too. Easily my favorite breakfast place. I just wish they were open later because I like breakfast at all times of the day.
I just had the pleasure of eating at T.C. Eggington's on Alma School in Mesa. \n\nT.C. Eggington's has been serving breakfast, lunch and brunch since 1985. It is a family owned restaurant that has won many awards for their homemade traditional recipes. \n\nI saw a picture of their Foster French on Yelp this morning and couldn't wait to try it for myself.\n\nWhen I got there, I was very pleased that they had plenty of parking out front. \n\nWalking in, I immediately noticed how clean and adorable the restaurant was. The decor made me feel like I was going over to Grandma's for breakfast. \n\nThe host was extremely helpful and considerate and the waiter was efficient and very polite.\n\nI ordered the Foster French and it looked exactly like advertised and it was super delicious!\n\nBreakfast was very reasonable, around $10 for one person, not including tip.\n\nThe breakfast menu also includes:\nFresh Baked English Muffins\nBreakfast Salad\nOatmeal\nOmelettes \nParlour Creations\nFrittatas\nGirdle Cakes:\nPlain, Honey Roasted Wheat Germ,\nCobbler-Stone Trail, Apple Jack, Blueberry\n\nThey also have delicious mimosas!\n\nHours: 6:30am - 2:30pm Daily\n\nFor more information:\ntcegg.com\n\nI 5/5 highly recommend T.C. Eggington's!
Great breakfast spot. Only been here once, but definitely ranks as one of the better breakfasts in the Valley.\n\nI had the Eggs Benedict. Good! My dad ordered the ham & eggs. Also good. The coffee was your typical bland \"diner\" coffee. Not a fan. They should upgrade to a more bold roast.\n\nOverall, we were satisfied though. I'd go back again.
Meeting a friend before heading to the airport.  Had a great meal.  Every dish was tasty with very fresh ingredients.  \n\nUsed the tip to call ahead and bypassed a lot of people waiting outside on an unseasonably chilly phoenix morn.
Meh. Bland French toast. Bland eggs and chorizo. Ambiance reminds me of Bob Evans or IHOP. The raspberry white mocha is way too sweet (and I asked for half the syrup). They're not getting my business again.
BNI group meets here every Wed. morning.  Had the Greek omelette and I simply loved it.  Fresh squeezed OJ as well.  The parfaits are very good too. Service is prompt and attentive.
It breaks my heart to visit a place help up with such high reviews be such a disappointment, I stopped in for a nice breakfast with my team before a meeting and was 110% disappointed with just about everything. We were seated right away which was great but that was just about the only good thing, if I where to recommend anything here it would be the orange juice and the water the food took almost 40 minutes and was only brought to us when we inquired about it only after the server gave us an attitude as if we were a burden. When we finally received our food it wasn't made properly we had half cold half warm food not even hot it was slightly warm.... When asked by owner how our experience was he became very hostile and incredibly rude because we didn't sugar coat the awful service. I'm having an incredibly hard time understanding how they have attained such high reviews
Really good omelettes for a fair price.\n\nService was kind of meh.
This has got to be one of the best breakfast restaurants around.  It has continued to serve delicious and out of the usual offerings for at least the last 15 years.  The service is spot on and it is cute.  (Even the bathroom is adorable.)\n\nMost recently I had the eggs benedict with avocado and no meat.  YUM!  Seriously good.  Looking forward to going back sometime soon.
So I recently got a job in the city of Mesa conveniently near T.C. And when I had to make a day trip to the joint (hardly a joint, more Scottsdale-esque) I was quickly floating on breakfast cloud 9.\n\nI love food, and I love to eat, and I LOVE a great breakfast brunch.  This place had it all!!! We went there after my graduation from college with a bunch of family, mostly of the elderly.  Let me first explain that going anywhere with my Grandpa is a mission in itself, nothing is ever cooked right and service is always too slow however he could not stop complimenting the staff on how great everything was (first time I have ever witnessed this in 22 years).  \n\nTC is a great place for family and celebrations or just to enjoy a great weekend brunch.  LET ME WARN YOU IF YOU GO ON A WEEKEND GO EARLY OR YOU WILL BE WAITING AROUND 30 minutes!
So yummy I'm not really a eating out breakfast person but this was fantastic. I had the  pastry with crab and artichoke. I got the hollandaise sauce on the side because I want sure I'd like it but that was delicious as well.
Ate here with my mom, whom I was visiting.  We had a yummy, yummy breakfast.  I had an omelette with so much goodness: bacon, ham, olives, mushrooms, onions, black olives and sour cream.  Not only was everyone there polite and cheery- our waitress brought me a cup of coffee to go as we didn't finish the carafe on the table!  Loved it!
The place was busy. We were greeted promptly at the door by our server and brought directly to our table. Coffee and drinks were delivered quickly, and our order was taken. The food was good, but the place was loud. Our server was on refills and even asked if we wanted a Diet to-go. The is no Sugar in the Raw, but the coffee is served in a nice carafe. Our server suggested the Honey Wheat-germ Pancakes. They were good, but way too much wheat-germ. The bacon was super greasy, so greasy that I had to pat the grease off with a spare napkin. The Chorizo-Frittata was good, but not at all spicy. The Home-Fries were ordinary and best. This was my first time to the place, I would go back if in the area, but would not make this a destination.
Best Breakfast Location in the Valley of the Sun!  This is the best place to take mom on Mother's Day and well worth the drive from anywhere in town!   I first found out about TC Eggington's in an MCC Small Business class back in 1988 when the owners spoke to our class. Needless to say have been hooked ever since!  That's 24 years!!!\n\nTo start with EVERY HUGE Omelette is a must our favorites are the:\n\nCottage Reef:  Savory crab meat and cream cheese dipped in a rich hollandaise sauce and topped with garden fresh artichoke hearts. This comes with a mound of homemade hashbrowns and English Toast too...you will not leave hungry!  \n\nAnother favorite is the Roasted Tuscan: Fire roasted eggplant, red peppers, garlic, zucchini, topped with fresh basil, sun dried tomatoes and feta cheese!\n\nThe boys like the Piglet's Passion:  diced ham, pork, sausage, bacon, green peppers, olives, tomatoes, onions, and assorted cheeses and one omelette is big enough for two! Priced at $8.95 each.\n\nWe love to get the orchard fresh fruit platter Cantalope, grapes, Kiwi, pineapple etc. with a giant english muffin on the side for an extra buck!\n\nThe Palour Creations are just as good try the Santa Fe Sautee pepper grilled chicken or the Crack of Dawn complete in it's own pan! \n\nWe love to get breakfast to go here on a Saturday morning and eat it with the kids at the Phoenix Zoo or Encanto Park or just before a family hike!  Cheers Here's to TC Eggington's!
This little spot can get really packed. The first time I was here there was a 20 minute wait. The 2nd time the restaurant was full, even though it was pretty late (about noon) on Sunday. \n\nThe coffee was excellent, strong and dark, and they set the pitcher on your table so you can get really caffeinated up. :)\n\nThe food and service was great. They've got some interesting breakfast selections on the menu. I'm not into sour cream, cream cheese, or feta on my eggs but for those a little more adventurous for breakfast, I'm sure would find those selections great. \n\nI just ordered eggs mixed with vegetables, potatoes, and cheese in a skillet. Very tasty. I guess next time I'll take the advice of others here and order the french toast! Yum.
This is probably the best breakfast place in the east valley. Athough we are new to the area, we have dined here several times before and have always come away with high praise. All the omelets are excellent and the pumpkin pancakes are yummy.  They do take reservations so if you want to avoid the long wait... 30 minutes or more on weekends, do call ahead.
I have been coming here for MANY years... Hands down the best food and service CONSISTENTLY... The owner is there all the time and most often everything thing runs like a well oiled machine.. I relocated to San Diego(even though we spend a lot of time in AZ) and have yet to find a TC Eggingtons replacement. Keep up the GREAT WORK...
This place is the best breakfast place here in Phoenix/Mesa. Worth the drive from any place in the valley as it does not get better than TC Eggington's! I will say that adding Biscuits and Gravy would be a wonderful thing! This could possible send me over the top if they added it! As many like Gravy with breakfast! But that should not stop you from enjoying a fantastic staple in the east valley... A little place that has consistant food and is well taken care of by it's owners! TC can be crazy at times peak breakfast hours and holidays so... Plan ahead and make a reservation! Its worth it!
I really can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before. This has been a family staple for us for many years. The Eggington Omelet & Eggs Benedict are my favorites. Multiple friends have Piglets Passion and the Crack Of Dawn on their favorites list. We have abandoned a camping trip at 6 am to make the trek down here from Payson for these dishes. The food is always great and the service is stellar.
Was hoping for crab benedict this morning. Was beyond disappointment. Luckily found out by asking that they use fake crabmeat like the kind in a Subway sandwich. Granted Im from Maryland and acknowledge that real crabmeat is hard to come by out here. That said I found it offensive and wrong that this place has the gall to trick people by not accurately depicting what their food is.  Call it Krab on the menu if thats what you use.. Servers and staff very friendly and accomodating. Service was slow. Got the veggie benedict. Was ok but nothing special. Potatos ok. Latte was gross. This place was way overpriced for the quality of food. I wont be back. Daily Dose in Scottsdale is where to go for crab benedict
I've been coming here for nearly 20 years with friends for our annual Christmas Eve breakfast. Just fantastic food. Started coming bi-weekly for brunch with my brother, who's an exec chef and says he hasn't found a better breakfast place. Love it. Great prices, very fresh food, and excellent service.
Out of this world French Toast. Did I make myself clear, the French Toast is TO DIE FOR!!\n\nI finally convinced, no really tricked my partner into coming here. By the time we decide we want breakfast on the weekends we're usually starving and a trip from Scottsdale to Mesa to wait in line for breakfast is just not in the cards.\n\nWell, today we planned a road trip and T.C. Eggington's was on the way, I am so happy it was. The service, other than on minor point was the absolute best and the food was great. I ordered the French Toast based on what I had read about this place and my partner ordered Pancakes. While both took a little longer than I would have wanted they were GREAT. The server was extremely friendly, just like everyone at the restaurant. Combine that with great food and it makes up for the food coming a little slower than I would have liked.\n\nIf you're in Mesa and want a great breakfast this is the place to come! You have to check it out...and order the French Toast. Take my word for it.
Toto we aren't in AZ anymore...it was like stepping into Connecticut! Very yuppy, sail boat outfits! Ok ok back to the actually experience, I called to make a reservation and they hadn't even written my name down until I came in and told them I called, so then we waited 5 mins. I ordered the raspberry white chocolate mocha which was pretty good and not overkill on the price. Then I had the blueberry girdie cake-no flavor! Bland blueberries and dry, not great pancakes. And if you didn't want some sort of egg dish, you are pretty sol!
Our friends are huge fans of this place so they took us after a morning hike.  Everything we had was delicious!  The pear omelet, the Piglet Passion omelet (bacon, ham and sausage), Apple Jack (pancake with apples, pecans and brown sugar cinnamon) and the french toast.  We sat outside which was nice with the misters.  The inside looked very nice and warming, they even had fresh daisies in vases on the tables.   Two things keeping us from going here more often - it's not close to where we live, and the price.  I think $27 for 2 people for breakfast is a little pricey but we'll keep it in mind for when visitors come to town or special occasions.  Safe to say you won't be disappointed if you go here.\n\n\"A day without eggs is just like any other day, but without eggs.\" \n-- T.C. Eggington
T.C. Egging tons is the place to go for breakfast , brunch , lunch ! Get here early because they get packed quick ! I love the \"Eggs Ben. E Dict\" so good !
I found this restaurant on yelp, I cannot begin to say how very good the food was. I had the crab stuffed in a pastry with artichoke and hollandaise sauce and a poached egg. It was truly one of the most wonderful things I have had to eat in recent memory. The parlour potatoes were also excellent. Brandi my server could not have been sweeter and so attentive. I highly recommend TC Eggington's.
Best breakfast in town.  I've eaten breakfast here for years and it's always been amazing. I would recommend it to anybody.
Just made reservations which made realize I should review them since we love this place!\n\nWe have been coming here since moving to the east valley 10 years ago. \n\nThe breakfasts here are really good!  Omelets, girdle cakes, parlour creations, egg cetera and frittatas. Best French Toast ever!! The cinnamon rolls are very good too. We always have left overs so it's like getting two breakfasts for the price of one.  \n\nI honestly can't comment on lunch because I have only eaten breakfast but based on that I would bet lunch is great too.\n\nServers are all clean cut, preppy looking, and VERY attentive...which is good because TCE is always packed.  They do take reservations which is good because you will need them on any holiday. \n\nSee you there Friday!
Oh, this was not good. Food not tasty. Overpriced not tasty food. If you're going to pay for a crab benedict, it should remotely taste like crab. And not be cold. Too busy, too long of a wait, too hungry to change. Other items tasted at our table did not receive much better feedback. I can't recall what others ate. In fact, there wasn't much worth remembering.
One of the best breakfast places ever! First time here. Drove 25 minutes from Gold Canyon based on Yelper's reviews and once again, Yelpers were right!!!\n\nHad Eggs Benedict and the Crack of Dawn Skillet. Hollandaise was on point! I still have dreams about that skillet. Perfect in every way. What was on the side, you ask? Two English Muffins. Um. What? Why am I talking about bread? Well, the english muffins are the bomb!! Seriously. Like my boyfriend almost busted into the kitchen to fond out where they get them from. They apparently get them from a local bakery. We might become stalkers.  Then, the waitress asked us if we had tried the apple cinnamon butter on the table. No. So, then we did and then our eyes popped out. Wow. No words! Insane!! \n\nUpdate: Second time back in one week. Had the Crab Stuffed Pastry and the Eggington Omelet. Soooo good! More English Muffins and Apple Butter! Also had an awesome Screwdriver and Mimosa! Great fresh squeezed OJ! Holy moly! Now when we eat breakfast anywhere else we are mad that we didn't just go back to The Egg. (Sigh)\n\nUpdate 6/1/15: I travel for a living and I won't be back to Arizona for 7 months. I'm sad. I miss this place. We have taken to comparing all breakfast places to TC Eggingtons. They don't compare. I'm 2000 miles away. (Sigh)
The staff was very friendly and polite and the food was absolutely excellent! Despite the 35 minute wait it was well worth it and we will definitely be back again!
Excellent,  it's been 17 years since I have been here and always had great memories and they still are rocking the breakfast menu! Great friendly service, nice farm decor, unique omelets.
First off, Joseph and Steven were such amazing workers. They made us feel so welcomed and put smiles on our faces. This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend because he knew how much I loved a Ncounter and apparently it's the parent company! I got the huevo con chorizo and it was delicious! The apple cinnamon jam is amazing you need to get the butter and English muffins and put the Jam on it!!! Everything was amazing this is a must visit!
If you're looking for a good meal with solid service you'll find it here.  The menu has something for everyone, too.  If you like to go out for lunch or brunch, this is a great place to go.  Friendly, fast staff helps make the experience that much better.
Where do I begin?!?!? This place is always amazing and never lacks in any area of hospitality, food or customer service! Be prepared to wait because there's always one and it is always worth it! They always have water, tea and coffee outside for guests and some seating so it makes the time pass a little easier. \n\nThe menu is extensive and there is truly something for everyone. The hardest part is trying new things every time I come because the last dish was so amazing! The servers uniforms are so cute, makes me feel like I'm in Kentucky for some odd strange reason. The Khakis with the light colored shirts they always look so crisp and clean!\n\nThe older gentleman that's always in he FOH (I believe he is the owner but not quite sure) is always patient and accommodating (as is the staff)! \n\nFor the professional bruncher: they have mimosas, bloody Mary's, bellini's and screw drivers- all for $5! You can't beat it! \n\nThey also have lunch- I've never had lunch here but I'm sure it's great! Why have lunch when you can have all this breakfast/brunch! \n\nI take everyone here and have yet to have any complaints..... In fact TC's quickly becomes one of their favs as well!
Quite frankly, there isn't a better breakfast in America (don't tell my wife). Although TC Eggintons is a bit expensive and always crowded, the breakfast food is second to none.\n\nI am personally a fan of the french toast but pretty much everything on the menu is divine. \n\nSince breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I would start it off here.
Ahhh freshly squeezed orange juice, yum.  I am a fan of their eggs benedict (without the ham) and roasted potatoes, very good.  The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is delicious and tastes just like home made cookin'! Just forget about going there on Sat or Sun morning unless you enjoy waiting and waiting and waiting some more. I suggest going on a weekday, you get seated right away. Great place to take the family for breakfast.
I have been there several times with girlfriends and always brag about it. Hubby and daughter were always super jealous. So... Today being the first day of Spring Break I decided they needed a special surprise!! I made reservations (not required but HIGHLY RECOMMEND because they are always packed).  We were seated right away and instantly you are comfortable in the country cozy decor.  I always get the same thing because when you have the best why switch? I am talking about the Farmer's Market Ben E Dict! Poached eggs with hollandaise check... But add spinach, tomato and Avocado... Yes please!! Absolutely delicious every time. My girlie girl got the same and was not disappointed with my recommendation. Hubby got the Cottage Reef omelet with crabmeat, artichoke hearts, cream cheese and hollandaise.... He cleaned his plate!  I have to admit that a small part of me wants to break out of my rut and go for the English toast with a French flair. Looks like we will be going back again and again!  Stay tuned for more :)
AMAZING! I love it. They have great English muffins and they cook everything perfect. I will definitely be going back! Two thumbs up!
Great breakfast and lunch options. Love the eggs Benedict here, made with real hollandaise sauce not cheese sauce some places use. They're small juices are very small but luckily ever table has it's own carafe of lemon ice water if you're a big drinker like me. Be prepared to wait if you show up on a weekend morning, good breakfast places always have a line.
Well this is the place that made me sign up for a Yelp account. Been here a handful of times now. A star for the ok to sometimes pretty good service - never terrible. \n\nNow, the food... It's not bad - if you're 600lbs and like to eat grease or buckets of sugar for breakfast. I've been more than once because my boyfriend sometimes enjoys southern cooking - if that tells you anything more about this place. This last time I went I got an egg white vegetable omelette because the pancakes and french toast  I had previously tried were a little too sweet and much. Sounds like a nice healthy option, right? Pretty sure they even used the word healthy on the menu's description. Hah. It was literally atop a LAKE of oil. I feel sick just thinking about it now. WHY? Why so much grease on everything here? Especially an egg white veggie omelette?? I don't get it! I used every napkin at the table and asked for more to soak some of it off my food, and still the omelette was dripping. Not an exaggeration - DRIPPING. SUCH a shame because I could tell the vegetables were fresh. And for some reason whoever dumped that crap all over the plate thought drizzling it all over the english muffin would be good too. Wtf?? There's fat American food and then there's this. I understand this place is kinda supposed to be like that - lots of hearty options, if you will? But this last time? It was just SO gross I had to mention for those who aren't interested in giving themselves heart problems with just one meal.\n\nIf no one else will say it, I will. T.C. Eggington's puts Paula Deen to shame. Just go to Denny's or Waffle House. You won't get mimosas with your meal but the food will taste the same and cost less!
Best breakfast, consistent for the past 15 years I have eaten there...and today I ventured to the lunch menu. Holy sandwich Batman! Turkey. Bacon. Cheddar. Apple. Caramelized Onions. Sun-dried Tomatoes. Do it!
When we eat out for breakfast with my parents on the East side of the Valley, it is always at TC Eggington's.\n\nThough we only make the drive across town a couple of times a year we are always greeted by name (we used to live on this side of town and came more often). \n\nMy wife swears by the crab cakes and I highly recommend the Crack o' Dawn. Also the apple jam on english muffin is not to be missed.\n\nIf I could eat here for breakfast every week I would.
We love this place! Never dissatisfied with a meal. It has an old, country feel. Great service and amazing breakfast!
I've been here a handful of times -- and need to go back for at least two more handfuls to try all the delicious things on their menu!  I'd advise going during the week, if possible.  On weekends the wait can be 30-40 minutes (long by Arizona standards).  \n\nPast choices included the crab and artichoke omelet, the crab topped pastry with poached egg, or French toast made with cinnamon bread, then dipped in a custard-like batter.  This past visit I had the Farmer's style Eggs Benedict that piled tomato, spinach, and avocado on an English muffin, then a poached egg and Hollandaise sauce.  Scrumptious!  The only thing I don't think I'd order again are the smoothies.  My adult son agreed -- healthy, but not all that flavorful.  \n\nNice touches at this restaurant.  Tables are set up with a carafe of water.  The menus have actual chicken wire sealed into the front cover.  This theme is carried through on the lamps.  \n\nAlthough they are known for breakfast, the lunch menu looked tantalizing, too.  Definitely a place to put on the favorites list!
Im not sure of we went on an off day but the service was slow. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the crab pastry with hollandaise. It was imitation and the hollandaise was obviously a powder. I could taste the butter flavored margarine on the potatoes. we will.not be going back. $30 for two people plus tip. Such a waste. Also the tables and high chairs were gross I had to wipe them down.
Finally after 20 some odd years, I am finally eating here . . . though not for breakfast, but for a light business lunch.\n\nWe were seated quickly, and our drink order taken . . . shortly after our drinks arrived, our wiatress returned to tak our order . . . I ordred the Balsamic Florentine Chicken Grille Sandwich.\n\nThe sandwich arrived in a reasonable amount of time . . . and was unbelievable.  The chicken was hot and moist . . . the mushroooms with the balsamic dressing were sweet and tasty . . . the cibatta roll was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  The black bean side salad was also good . . . the problem was I wanted to finish my whole sandwich . . . so I did have some salad left over.\n\nThe reason for the loss of a star was simple . . . our waitress did stop back and check on us once, but since we were there for over an hour . . . I would have light to have had somewon from the restaurant check back with us.\n\nReturn trip . . . Most Definitely . . .
Since we were on vacation, I searched Yelp for breakfast recommendations which ultimately lead us to this restaurant. I thought I had read majority of the reviews for this location; it primarily had positive descriptions about great food and a home-like environment. \nWhen we arrived, we were immediately seated. Our server asked us if we were ready to order and  we asked for a few more minutes. Our service rapidly went downhill from there. \nOur server did not come back for roughly fifteen minutes. She served a table across of us, possible family/friends: she took their order, brought their drinks and food before attending to our table. \nWhen she came back, we quickly ordered and thankfully received our order in a timely manner. That was the last time we saw her. \nAt this point, our drinks were not refilled and we had to ask a hostess to refill our drink since our waitress was busy moving from table to table. I understand that the restaurant became very busy at this point but we just wanted to leave; I was ready to inform the manager at this point of our service but she finally came back. \nBottom line: we did not tip her nor do we recommend coming here. Although the food tasted great, it's not worth the service.
Lackluster, flavorless breakfast. Do not go out of your way to come here. I was shocked at how many people were waiting to eat here. I ordered the poached eggs with toast and potatoes. They overcooked the eggs; a place with the word EGG in the title should be able to properly poach an egg. The potatoes were very basic and sad. The bacon my dad ordered was fatty and kinda undercooked. The big killer is that the prices were more expensive than a diner yet the quality of the food was the same.
I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was bland. The French toast was huge, light and airy but the syrup tasted like it was out of a Kroger brand bottle. Also the oj was not fresh, probably out of a frozen concentrate. \n\nThe service was good and prices ok.
This is my most favorite Breakfast spot.  We went here on Sunday, and we got there at approx 11am, the hostess guy said we had a 15 minute wait and we walked around and when we came back they already had called our name, so they got us right in.   \nWe ordered a Egg White ham and cheese omelet, with olives, bell peppers, and blacks olives (not overly greasy) and the portions are so large they were able to split one serving into two, with a serving of home fries, and English muffin, coffee and a cup of steel oats with brown sugar and raisins for each of us, and all this for under $25.00.\nI would really recommend this place if you have out of town guest,  it would be a great treat to take them here, and not bad on the wallet.\nThe staff is phenomenal, and the decor is french country, it's cute.
Quite a good breakfast.  Very good selection of food.  If it were closer, I would eat here often.
My newly relocated friend had heard this was an excellent brunch spot so we met up here around 10am. I had the French Toast Foster which is the English Toast with bananas and a brown butter syrup. The toast was super thick and delicious, I also ordered 2 over medium eggs on the side which were cooked perfectly.\n\nMy friend on the other hand was disappointed in her pear and havarti omelette. She is a vegetarian and requested the dish without the bacon. Perhaps the bacon was the missing ingredient because she said there wasn't anything special about the omelette with a skimpy portion of pear, and a slice of cheese paper included.
I've been meaning to update this for awhile, just hadn't gotten around to it.  I cannot, in good faith, leave my rating of Eggington's with 1 star.  This is my go-to, staple, home-grown, proud-to-be-a-native-Phoenician breakfast place.  I've never brought anyone here that didn't have wonderful things to say about it, and the food is absolutely wonderful.  The same owners, recipes are constant and haven't changed on the quality of ingredients.  I don't know what I shall do if they ever close...\n\nThe Egginton Omlette is probably my favorite, but with a pancake on the side.  Followed by their eggs benedict.  Lunch isn't bad either!  But go for the breakfast.
Lived up to the hype. The spicy Spain was delicious. As was the oj..very cozy spot with reasonable prices. Will go again
Best french toast ever! This place is always busy and there is a reason, the food is great! I have been coming here for probably about 5 years now and can't believe I have never written a review! I love the atmosphere, fun, quirky and good service all the time even though it is always full. Some of the same people have been working here for as long as I can remember so they must be a good place to work as well because staff just doesn't stay like that. My daughter loves their omelets, my friend and her daughter loved the sandwiches. We never have a complaint and any time someone wants breakfast this is where I suggest.
TC Eggingtons is so Delish!! I go here for breakfast at least once every time I'm in Arizona. \nWhere do I begin.. The apple jelly, the fresh orange juice, the giant blueberry pancake, and the most amazing omelette/frittata selection you can possible imagine. I highly suggest going with a group so you can sample eachothers food and split the blueberry hill pancake.
Everything about Mamakas is perfect.  The staff is very informative and helpful. I had no reservation and waited only 20mins on a Friday night. This place is always packed! It's worth awaiting for! Seating by the kitchen is fun and entertaining. \nThanks Chris!
Stopped by Mamakas on a friday night without a reservation, it was quite packed. We were second in line, but were seated very quickly at the kitchen.\n\nService was fast, friendly and knowledgeable. I found the menu hard to navigate as I was unfamiliar with a lot of the terminology but the server was great at explaining.\nSitting by the kitchen, we were also able to interact with the kitchen staff who were also friendly.\nFood was delicious, on the higher end in terms of price but definitely worth it.
Really great. The only downside was the hostess!!! She was VILE. So rude and bitchy. We almost turned around and left right there, but I'm really glad we didn't, as the server was beyond pleasant and very good at his job, and the food was yummy. Also a great atmosphere! Go figure, after driving across town for years to get mediocre Greek food on the danforth, we found the best in the city 2 minutes from our front door!
A friend recently claimed Mamakas to be the best restaurant in Toronto right now. I am always skeptical of such claims, especially because I went to Alo for my last birthday. Decided to give this a go anyway and see what the hype is about!\n\nWe walked in and all the tables were reserved so we were offered a seat at the bar by the hostess, which I am totally ok with because you get to see the chefs working and that's always super fun. You get more of an insight on how things are prepared and how the kitchen is run.\n\nThe server was pretty friendly, and gave us a rundown of the menu and an idea of how much we should order. I asked a couple of questions about what we should get and she was helpful, except for one tiny, but annoying error - I will explain more shortly. \n\nWhat we got:\n- tzatziki dip: this was delicious and addictive, with fresh dill. what the server forgot to mention was that the lamb we ordered also comes with this dip, so this was a double order. if we had known, we would have tried another app\n- house made pita: we ordered these once and then ordered them again cause they were freaking amazing and also because of the repeat dip that came with the lamb. they grill these and then season them \"salt bae\" style before they are served. the salt comes as a nice burst of flavour and crunch with some bites\n- fried smelts: YUM, addictive little salty bites of goodness, served with some kind of aioli \n- greek salad: the most authentic greek salad i've had outside of greece. came with a big slab of GOOD feta at the top\n- the lamb main: grilled, with a nice char, but a little rare for my liking - although my husband loved this. came with more tzatziki, which annoyed me lol\n- the octopus main: the way they prepare this is sous-vide and then grilled, which makes it perfect. it comes on a bed of santorini fava, which i found to be a bit grainy, could have been creamier. but i enjoyed this more than the lamb\n- baklava + ice cream dessert: good baklava, good ice cream. not too sweet and a well balanced dessert\n- aphrodite cocktail: good, cute cup, not too sweet \n- siko old fashioned cocktail: my husband enjoyed it\n\nis this the best restaurant in toronto? no. is it worth a try and worth going back? absolutely, yes. the tea smoked chicken and whole fish (they debone it after it's grilled - i love a good whole, deboned fish!) are on my list of mains to try next time!
Oh ma gaw. Just had one of the best meals I've ever had at Mamakas.\n\nFull disclosure: I didn't pay for anything/don't even know how much our meal cost, so this review is strictly about food and service... Which were so flawless that Beyonce would have to change her song to \"Somewhat Flawed, Actually.\"\n\nOur server recommended the Fix Hellas for me, as I like lighter beers, and it was perfect. My family raved about their cocktails.\n\nMy family and I had a six?-course prix fixe meal:\n\n1. Pita + four dips\n2. Cured swordfish + spanakopita\n3. Tomato/feta/cucumber salad\n4. Grilled lambchops with couscous salad + garlic fries\n5. Grilled octopus over a fava bean sauce\n6. Baklava + ice cream\n\nThe lamb was so goddamn juicy and delicious. The tomato/feta/cucumber salad was another favourite. There was enough food to feed a TDSB classroom, but we managed to finish most of it.\n\nService was really good... Our server was knowledgeable, charming, and generally on POINT. There was also what sounded like Greek house music playing in the restaurant, which made for good (but loud-ish) vibes. Walls are all white, giving it that Santorini feel.\n\nSo, so good though.
Beautiful decor and ambiance. Lovely and refined wine selection and boutique crafted cocktails are gorgeous and well designed. The food... hmm. .. difficult. Get some help from the wait staff for sure.  (Who are lovely, effecient and so professional.) Bc the sharing plates are significant but the mains are small etc. The fries are divine, a true double fried frites that are seasoned plenty and leave a lasting impression. \n\nOnly order the smelts if you are die hard into them or have more then two table mates hahaha... Bc omg the serving is massive and also delicious. The spreads and pita are too die for. The olives are a definite skip, not worth it, over burdened with spices and oil and very hard. Apparently they are supposed to be, so if that's your thing... well enjoy! But I'm more of a olive crazed lunatic so I want my olives ripe, succulent and varied. \nThe saganaki was understated and adorned with figs, honey and walnuts making it my favourite item 100%. The Parmasan crusted asparagus was my second fave. \n\nThe sausage and hummus dish. Not my bag, S.O. loved it. To me it was far too.... everything. The texture was more towards overcooked even though it certainly was not and the spicing was too fall/winter for me. Again, S.O. loved it, but he likes pumpkin spice and is a simple betch whereas I'm a fussy orenary 90 yr old with halatosis so... grain of salt. \n\nWill absolutely return for sharing with more ppl, but would gladly attend for a romantic date as well.
Easily one my my favourite restaurants in Toronto.\n\nNot only does Mamakas serve upscale flavourful greek dishes, they match it with a bustling and energetic environment.  Mamakas executed simple dishes with flair and finesse.  The simplistic spanokopita was brought alive with sweetness from the glazed honey which complemented perfectly with the acidity from the underlying yogurt spread. The lamb chops were possibly the best lamb chops that I've had. The spread of tzatziki underneath the lamb chops was so good that it could probably be a dish on its own!\n\nI would definitely come back once, twice, and possibly many more times for the spanokopita and the lamb chops!
This is probably my new favourite restaurant in Toronto. The sea bass and lamb are unreal. This would be an amazing date spot too!
Ate at this place last week and loved it!  The place was packed and the food was fantastic.  We had the spanakopita, which was so delicious, we had another!  Then we had the lamb chops and the octopus as mains.  I loved them both.  And then finished it off with a black pepper infused goat milk rum drink with goat cheesecake with a fig.  It was so delicious that I was having what I call, food orgasms all night.  The atmosphere was wonderful, staff were fun and the owner and main bartender are both so passionate about what they are doing, it was nice to watch and relish in their creations.
Excellent restaurant.  I've been here twice now,  once for work and once with my wife,  and both experiences were excellent. Staff is friendly,  service is quick,  and the food is great!\n\nIm partial to the dips you get as appetizers.  I think I could subsists on  a few of those and their flatbread for a few weeks.
I don't have much experience with Greek cuisine outside of fast food like souvlaki and gyros, so I decided to go with the modern-Greek route for an introduction. \n\nMamakas is on the hipster Ossington strip, where creativity is never lacking. The menu at Mamakas appeared to consist of dishes using a Greek foundation, then altered with up-to-date cooking techniques and seasonal local ingredients. \n\nI started off with what the owner highly recommended, the xifias, to contrast the rich flavors of the meaty main dishes. The xifias is unlike most of the appetizers, in that it's a cold dish, consisting of thin swordfish sashimi sprinkled with fennel, dill, radish, chili, and a few pieces of sea asparagus. The fish was sheet-thin but still had a meaty flesh, it tasted generally mild but easily soaked up the bright lemon sauce and herbally dill. I have heard of a Greek swordfish steak before, but never seen swordfish served the way Mamakas hprepared it. This truly demonstrates the theme of Mamakas reinventing dishes using the Greek recipe core and local vegetables.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the rabbit stifado. This dish was the reason I came to Mamakas, after seeing it highlighted in a travel magazine that I read at my hotel. The stifado not quite served as a stew in a pot as you might imagine, the Mamakas version is an individual portion and served on big plate. It contained a succulent rabbit leg braised in wine, sweet chopped vegetables, and peppercorns, then placed over a creamy puree of artichokes. The rabbit meat was accompanied with roasted onions, which had the best caramelized flavor I had ever experienced. \n\nService was exceptional from the moment I stepped through the door. The owner was genuine, energetic, and friendly, he definitely knows hospitality and how to entertain guests.\n\nThe prices were somewhat higher than expected, but justified due to the use of local fresh ingredients in a very unique and creative way. After a great meal at Mamakas, I definitely want to return the next time I'm in town, and also try a traditional Greek restaurant on Danforth to see the difference.
I had a huge craving for some really good wonton soup! Used yelp to help me find some around this area & I discovered this little hidden gem. This cafe is inside of the city hall building. \n\nI ordered wonton soup & also added noodles to it! I believe the wonton are homemade. The meat inside of them are so well seasoned. The portion of the soup was pretty decent for the price. The egg noodles really added a nice touch to the soup. Although the broth was slightly a little too sweet for my liking. Overall the soup really hit the spot for me!
This place is located inside Peoria City Hall, and I wish I work there so I can eat this every day! Jk...I'd be broke.\n\nFood-excellent! I was surprised. Normally food places inside a company building aren't that great, but this was! I don't remember the name of what I got, but it was this soup noodle. Both were very delicious, and everything on the menu looked good.\n\nThe place was very clean, and the owners were very nice. Parking was easy to find; they have a guest parking in the back and it's a close walk to the cafe. I would definitely go back. Go try it out!!
Holy Mole this place is good!\n\nClean, friendly & delicious!\n\nI love it and I will be back to visit often.\nGreat Place!\nAuthentic & Family owned.
A nice spot to get some Vietnamese food. I had the house soup and it was quite good. The owner and staff are very friendly and inviting.
When I learned that Anise Cafe was closed I about died! I'm sure a lot of people felt the same way. When I found out they just changed name and new location I was jumping off the wall! Why? It's simple The food is delicious, outstanding service!, pleasant environment!  I am now a happy happy person!
What a hidden gem. This is inside the court house so WHO KNEW!! This place is a must!! What amazing Tai food I was blown away from the flavor the broth the way each ingredient had its individuality even tho it sat in a bowl of broth. I could not get enough. This is a mom AN pop place Ann the owner came out and greeted us and was very sweet. The spring rolls were fresh and one bite as delicious as the next. I will definitely go back next time I am in Peoria. Make sure you go early as they keep court hours. Do not let the fact that they are in a court house deter you from going. Happy Eating.
Very pleasant lunch in a super clean in the chrerful environmrnt of the Peoria City Hall. Greeted with many smiles and suggestions for my lunch. I tried the banh mi (I am not sure of spelling),  sandwich with chicken and it was great. The chewey bread filled with chicken,  pickled carrot, daikon and cilantro with a sauce worked well together. I will go back to try more of their menu at this hidden gem. Try it ss you will too be a fan
I love their pho I have order beef pho 3 times now and each time more delicious than the last! I love it here, a little hard to find since its inside the city hall building but once you find it you'll love it. Its clean!!! And the food is made to order and fresh
I haven't been to this place in 15 years. But now those back in the area I desperately wanted to try it again and it did not disappoint. The selection on the buffet is amazing and outstanding and the food is really good. The service is excellent the wait staff is friendly the manager came over to say hello and ask how things were great experience would highly recommend the place we're from New York but certainly would come here again.
Zero happiness exists in this location and just outright rude service.\nThe managers treat you like you are bothering them if you make a request for more shrimp in a take out order even if you pay whatever they ask.
I've been to this location many times and the table service is always horrible. Since this is a buffet, the only job of your server is to clear the dishes off of your table and to bring drinks to your table.  As always, the dishes at my table piled up while my server continued to walk around the dining area and collect dishes from other tables, I had to flag him down and tell him to take my dishes away. He also forgot to bring water to my table, forgot to bring us straws, and didn't fill our glasses as they emptied. \nThis random server girl brought us our bill early while my guests were still eating, the manager (woman in blazer) came to our table to apologize. When it came time to pay the bill I did something that I have never done in my entire life, I LEFT NO TIP. \nI was beginning to feel a tad guilty, but I knew I had made the right decision when the server ripped the receipt and tossed it into my lap and walked away without a word. I mean, you had to have seen this coming. \n\nOn another occasion I recall my servers secretly including a $15 \"service fee\"  on every one of my friend's bills (we paid separately) , none of us noticed and included a tip in the cost. It was after my friend asked for a detailed receipt that we all noticed this. There were eight of us so they secretly got $120 in tips from my table.\n\nA word of advice, ask for a detailed receipt before swiping your credit card here.
Awesome service. Great food. Clean place. Would definitely recommend it. I've been to other Mandarin Restaurant before but this one way better service and much cleaner.
I loved the food when I first got there. By the end, everything seemed to taste the same. Maybe I shouldn't have went back to the buffet for my 6th serving.
Every Mandarin is identical, and this one is no different. The food is passable but bland and uninspired. Their fish is horribly cooked - dry and tough - and their holiday specials (e.g., lobster thermidor) are poorly done and not worth the hefty surcharge. There are many better buffets in the GTA so I suggest you go there. \n\nOther issues: their seating is painfully slow. Each hostess takes one guest at a time, so even when there are dozens of empty tables you could wait 10 minutes to sit if a few people are in front. Learn from the big buffets and seat multiple parties at once.\n\nOn the plus side, Mandarin is clean.
Make sure you have a reservation, and come 10 minutes prior to your requested time so you get a table a.s.a.p as this place is often crowded around the dinner time rush. With that said, the food is great, and depending on what day you go, there is always added specials to satisfy your taste buds. Drinks are extra cost, but they do have a variety of drinks to choose from. The place is kept clean, even though there are a few chairs and tables that could be replaced as the overuse of them can be seen and felt when sat on or touched. With that said, one of the better locations. Been here 5 or 6 times, and will come again ( with reservations ) when I am in the area
Possibly the worst Chinese takeaway I've had in any country in the world.\n\nOvercooked, old wonton. Over-sweet, tough spare ribs. Very sad looking prawns in way too much garlic (and I like garlic, but this dish could kill a vampire).\n\nPerhaps good if you go for the buffet, but NEVER take away from this place as they'll just give you all the old stuff. Steer clear.
Two stars are generally reserved for places that have pretty bad food and have good service. If a place has horrible food and bad service, that's a one star restaurant in my book.\n\nWith that said, the food here is just bad. But most buffets have bad food, especially with a name like Mandarin or Hong Kong or Chinese stuck in it somewhere. Avoid those places unless you don't mind cutting your life short by a few years, gaining a few pounds, and most likely getting diarrhea in the process. If you don't shit yourself after eating here, you will down the road and remember it's because you ate here.\n\nParking: Plenty\nPrice: Not worth it\nWait: Long just to get seated
Located in the Industrial Heartland of North York, this location provides the variety you crave.\n My mid-week arrival with the Birthday Girl was delightful...my strategy is to start light and pick out a huge prime rib bone to gnaw on for the night. \nNo surprises here...I have been to ALL their locations..attentive service...\nclean utensils....my date went well !
Finch location. Ordered barbecue spare ribs for take out around 3:00 p.m.  They don not have them on the lunch buffet, only dinner, so I specifically requested that they be made fresh. Got the order home a few minutes later only to find they were ice cold, dry and drowned in sauce.  Obviously they had been cooked the day before, taken from the fridge, put in a container and given to me for my take out order.  I called and spoke to the manager who gave me a credit but what he should have offered me was a complimentary dinner to compensate for the fact that I drove over there and was given day old food which was inedible.
This restaurant is one of the worst restaurant I've ever ate at.... \nThe food is not good as I expected. The waiters aren't that nice either. They spoke way too fast as if they are in a rush. The only good thing about it is that they have a variety of drinks and that's about it .-. \nI don't recommend this restaurant.
I had a good lunch here. Like all buffets part of the Mandarin chain, it is clean and offers pretty good food.
Well, when you've got teenaged boys around, (they're always hungry), and it's too hot to cook you go to a Buffet. I hadn't been to this location in some years. It was my favorite back then and I was not disappointed this time either. I tried some of everything. The prime rib was juicy and tender, the sushi was fresh and all of the Chinese fare was delicious. (wasn't crazy about the seaweed salad though...ugh). My only gripe is that even with a reservation we had to wait a while to be seated. But  that's not new. If you want to eat here best make that reservation. I have gone a couple of times just spur of the moment and couldn't get in.
It's a nice family restaurant. The food choices are decent, the place is clean and well organized. Overall a very pleasant experience that I would recommend.
The last time I went to Mandarin restaurant was about 14 years ago at the Yonge and Eglinton location. I decided to come to this branch for good old times sake and because I didn't know they would differ. The service kind of lagged, since they did not take our empty plates on time and when I had no choice but to place my empty plate on the empty table next to us, they complained that I shouldn't do so. Well, where am I supposed to put my plate when you don't pick it up on time?\nI only enjoyed the lobster legs and everything else was extremely mediocre. I can't recommend this place at all, since the quality is very low and the options are small.\nIt literally feels like going to an all you can eat Chinese take out at your local mall. If that's your thing then by all means come here. If not, don't waste your money and consume your high sugar, high glutamate dish with fattening low quality desert.\nI only give this place a 2 star, since another waiter helped me teach how to get the meat out of the lobster leg. By the way, there's no proper lobster utensil to use at this place.
I feel like I'm in the twilight zone!\n\nI read the reviews going here and was VERY worried! My wife wanted to try it and so I went hesitantly.\n\nThis place was INCREDIBLE!\n\nFood was great, ambience was phenomenal, service was impeccable, and location unbeatable.\n\nWith your food (which you get a ton of) they bring fresh squeezed juice shots, a bowl of fruit, homemade jam, and fresh maple syrup.\n\nThey may have changed since the other reviewers but I find this place unreal.\n\nHIGHLY recommend.
1. C'est dispendieux par rapport \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9.\n2. C'est dispendieux par rapport \u00e0 la portion de l'assiette.\n3. Ce n'est pas app\u00e9tissant par rapport \u00e0 la fraicheur des ingr\u00e9dients.\n4. Le service n'est pas leurs points forts.
Very ordinary but it's a historic house at the corner of the main and the Church. The ladies had the Chinese fondue and the guys the crepes au gratin. \n\nThe fondue liquid was lukewarm and even with the little heating candle underneath the po, it never brought the broth to boil. Meat was scarce and there was about 4 regular sized shrimps. Ladies weren't impressed.\n\nThe crepes were very hot having been in the oven to melt the cheese. The white b\u00e9chamel sauce was average, a bit on the salty side. I had the ratatouille crepe and I liked it, but also on the salty side. What's with these cooks? The plates were quite small for a main course dish. Guys weren't impressed either.\n\nThe waiter was doing his best to keep everyone happy on that hot Sunday evening.\n\nAll in all, I wanted to eat a crepe, I did and I'll go somewhere else now. This restaurant's attraction is the deck and the view, not the food.
Stumbled across this charming hole in the wall on the way to dim sum. Fabulous. Shrimp po boy was unbelievably good. Excellent fries. Prices are too low!
Very good sandwiches.\n\nI tried 2 different kinds the Po boy and it was fantastic, shrimp was fried perfectly. And the Porchetta, this was good but was lacking the crunch of some cracklin, if they added that it would have been perfect.\n\nOverall though, this place is worth going to.
Awesome...simply awesome! It so great to go to a place where the take their craft seriously. Even better when the finished product is stellar! I had the porchetta sandwich and certainly ranks as best in the city. The crackling shines in this awesome Mexican inspired rendition of this classic sandwich. The people beside were raving about the steak and shrimp po' boy sandwiches. I can't wait to try those next time. \n\nAlso, the staff was super friendly and the place just oozes cool. I'll be a regular for sure!!
This place would appeal most to the MacDonald's generation. Based on the rave reviews I would say the MacDonald's crowed has found it. Giving away free hot chocolate daily is a good indication of their need for business. The Brick Oven Bakery on Logan at Queen still holds the title for best Leslieville Sandwich at only $7.50. tax included. They are also working the marketing angle and have every friend write a positive review.  Been here a few times since my first review below and I am not as hot about this place as previous.  Sully's started off good but they seem to keep dropping the ball. The giant mirror (what were they thinking) has got to go. Imagine eating a messy sandwich while looking at yourself in a giant mirror 3 feet away, not pretty. I notice now people sit with their back to the mirror starring at the wall.\n\nYou won't get a nicer bunch of servers but that's just not good enough. This is a tiny sandwich place so grab and go is important. I waited over 30 minutes for my sandwich, it was obvious my order got pushed back for some unorganized reason. I'm not impressed and not happy. If they get your order right, it could be enjoyable, they don't, usually they drop the ball. \n\nThe shrimp sandwich is sully's version of a New Orleans classic sandwich. Not eve close to the real thing but tasty. I wouldn't go back\n\nDefinitely not a winning formula. I would recommend to only go during off hours, only problem is, they have very restricted hours making it a place you cannot rely on.
Addicted to the Shrimp Po Boy! As a sandwich enthusiast I give Sullys Sandwiches a glowing recommendation. The ingredients are fresh and flavourful, the Po Boy alone is composed of a perfect combination of texture: crunchy shrimp tempura, delicious southern slaw and a creamy aioli to set off the tempura, complete with a perfect bun. Will be returning as often as possible!
This little sandwich outpost just east of Gerrard strip of Chinatown East was on my radar for a long time.  But everytime I swung by, I was either not hungry or the place was closed (open til 6pm, closed Sundays).\n\nNow, I'm always wary of hyped-up, trendy, pricey sandwich joints that claim higher quality but always lack that 'oomph' and leave you unsatisfied in portion size and flavour.  However, I had hope for this place considering the relatively odd location and odd hours (let's face it, if it's open all hours in a busy part of town -- it doesn't need to be good).  And I'm glad to report this place is legit.\n\nService is friendly and I was recommended to try either the shrimp po' boy or the porchetta for a first-timer.  I decided on the po' boy and it was godamned delicious.  It was loaded with large tempura-fried fresh shrimp and all the ingredients (romaine, slaw, tomato, and a light aioli with a light kick) complemented the shrimp and didn't overpower it.  In addition, I find most sandwich joints use shitty bread -- not here.  Just right the thickness and texture and the sandwich was built beautifully for no 'dry bites'.  A steal for $8.\n\nI had a bite of the Meatless (tempura battered and marinated tofu, sesame mustard and Asian slaw) and it was decent - perhaps a bit salty and lacked texture - but my vegetarian girlfriend really liked it (she usually has to settle for 'after thought' veggie options) as it had protein and the flavour was well layered.  And ya, DAT BUN again - so good.\n\nThe place doesn't reinvent the sandwich - but crafted everything just right.  I actually found myself thinking about the delicious po' boy hours after having it (doing our weekend shop in Chinatown).  Now, that's fucking impressive.\n\nThe place may take the 'consciously crafted' label a bit too seriously - no pop on offer, just Pellegrino and flat/sparkling water.  But service was friendly and the sandwiches do all the talking.  Also, there is a shelf of random table games and toys to keep yourself entertained while you wait for your sandwich to be constructed.\n\nWill definitely be back to try the porchetta - will hold off on the full-bird five stars to make sure it wasn't a fluke - but ya, I really like this simple sandwich joint.
Great & reasonable  $ sandwiches.  Checkout the new outdoor patio.\n\nHad the shrimp posted boy - enough for two to split - only  $8 bucks.
Sully's popped up quietly like a hip ninja on the quiet-but-slowly-blooming-if-ever Gerrard/Logan dead storefronts stretch that I walk by every single day back in my high school days. To some, it's a welcomed addition to the area. For others it's just a place for great gourmet sandwiches, run by a guy who also runs a downtown hotel restaurant and is apparently dead serious about quality \"consciously crafted food\" and sandwich-making as a skill.\n\nThe establishment itself is small, with a bar height table seating six and barely any more room for a lineup.** The decor seems at an inexplicable crossroads between bare bones basics (with a depressingly empty shelf on one wall) and cliche hipster reclaimed wood aesthetics from the hip down (trying to be inspired by shipbuilding with them rope details?).\n\nI'm not as big about sandwiches as owner Michael 'Sully' may be, but you know what? They make some pretty decent sandwiches. They have a tiny and straightfoward menu, with sandwiches including a meatless Banh mi-style option on board. The $8 porchetta sandwich is a delicious conservative choice, packing a good mix of juicy pork, crunchiness and a kick of heat from the jalapeno aioli every second or third bite. The steak ($8) however, now that's a big mouthful of fun in a handful. It comes with fries... in the sandwich; it's a takeout meal slapped in between two buns! Oh yes, them buns they use: slightly crispy, very soft, holds everything in place without getting soggy quickly, and definitely the perfect bread for any sandwich you'll want to eat. Go to hell, Wonder bread!\n\nThere's one minor inconvenience though. They do have a habit of being closed inexplicably when they say they would be open--their hours of 11 to 1800h are not posted anywhere in the window but rather appears on their Twitter account (@sullyssandwich - they apparently too kool for a webz site or even hours on the window). I guess the most reliable indicator is to see if the lights are on and their sandwich board is out listing their off-menu daily specials. And they definitely don't open on Sundays.\n\nAlso, only soft drinks served. You want beer like a true hipsta (like they sometimes suggest on their Twitter feed)? You could go across the street to the Beer Store, score a can, sit at the curb and kick it real old school Leslieville/South Riverdale. Just sayin'.\n\n**edit addendum May 2015: they installed two picnic tables out front, effectively more than doubling their on-site eat-in capacity. Yea.\n\n{TTC: 506 streetcar to Logan Ave. No sandwich sign out for a sandwich shop, no open lah.}
Out of all the sandwich shops in Leslieville, Riverside, and Riverdale, this one makes me drool the most.\n\nTheir sandwiches are the standard $6-$8 for the area, but they're so full of flavour, and what makes it the best in my books is the bread. They use this brioche bun (maybe?) that's so soft and sweet, and it perfectly matches the density and flavour of the rest of the sandwich so you're not squeezing out the contents with every bite. That and it's not too much bread that it's the only thing you taste.\n\nSo far I've had their steak sandwich, which only recently made it onto their permanent menu, and the ADB (all-day breakfast) sandwich. Both so amazing. It makes the walk up to the restaurant (even in -20C weather) worth it. So so worth it.
Wowww best sandwiches I've had in a longg time!! \nHad the Porchetta (which was soft and fatty and delicious) and the Shrimp Po Boy (crispy and saucy). Both were amazing, really. The bread they use is perfect because it soaks up the sauce without getting soggy. Can't wait to come back.
I work in the neighborhood and decided to pop in for lunch today having heard good things. I was not disappointed! The guy behind the counter recommended the porchetta sandwich. I brought it back to work to eat and it was fantastic. Great value for the price, the sandwich was loaded up. The meat was rich and flavourful and toppings are a roasted jalape?o and queso fresco which gives it just the right amount of spice and texture. There was also cracking which I could have used a bit more of to give it a little more crunch! My only complaint would be that the bun got a bit soggy on the walk back to the office, so it was a bit messy to eat. Next time I might ask them to cut it in half for me to make it easier. Otherwise completely spot on, I will definitely be back to try some of the other items here!
The place has a great feel the moment you walk in. Even as a first timer, they treated me as if they knew me. \nSimple menu, packed with flavorful options. I had chicken, bf had shrimp sandwich. The sauce in the shrimp sandwich was unreal! The fries were delicious too :)
Had the shrimp po boy. It was better than the one I had in New Orleans! Super friendly staff too. I highly recommend.
A hidden gem fo' sho'! \n\nI had the Shrimp Po' Boy (tempura shrimp, southern slaw, romaine, tomato & creole aioli, $8) but all the sandwiches sounded appealing. Definitely the best sandwich I've had in recent memory and that's saying a lot as I'm not a huge fan of sandwiches in general. \n\nI was torn between the sandwich I had and the porchetta sandwich (roasted poblano, pickled red onion, queso fresco, tomatillo, lime and jalepeno aioli). There was also a steak sandwich that seemed to be a popular choice.\n\nThe sandwich was HUGE but not too heavy thanks to the pillowy bun. I did find it filling but mostly because it was huge and because I scarfed that sucker down like Kobayashi in competition. The tempura coating on the shrimp was nice and crisp and the shrimp themselves not overcooked. The textures of the sandwich held up surprisingly well considering I got the sandwich to go - it did not become soggy during the 10 minute trip home.\n\nCan't wait to visit Sully's again to try some of the other sandwiches!
5 stars for the bun alone, it's perfect.\n\nThe skirt steak sandwich is awesome.
Amazing tofu sandwich with an asian twist. Would have wanted it slightly bigger for the price but overall a must try sandwich shop. Flavors were excellent.
Okay, yes. Perfection. Why aren't there more places like this? All a starving bitch wants once in a while is a well priced sandwich that isn't from Subway that you can eat in without feeling awkward or take out like a bandit and scarf down in the car, making humming sounds while chewing.\n\nMy stupidity here was that I read about this place back in January during the Polar Vortex Redux and super excited to try the place, I drove over, parked the car around the corner and whipped in to get the po boy which was the star of all the reviews, except it wasn't on the menu...wtf? \"There's no po boy,\" said the girl adamantly. I argued to no avail: \"IT'S IN ALL THE REVIEWS, ARE YOU SURE?\" she shrugged  and I ordered a sandwich, any sandwich, I don't fucking remember what was in it but it went in my mouth and eventually out the other end without fanfare. I ate in, with a bunch of Riverdale ageing saggy titted hipster types, drinking coffee while their dander had formed stucco patterns on the walls, I was suspicious something was wrong...THEN! When I left the place, bundling myself back up in my goddamn feather shedding parka that I've since burned, I looked to the east and saw the Sully's sandwich board two doors over and I  realized I WAS IN THE WRONG FUCKN SANDWICH SHOP. I was so mad that I filled myself up with another sandwich without my intent that I blocked the whole thing out of my mind and went home and watched a bunch of Netflix for 6 months.\n\nIt was like I banged some dumbass roadie instead of the rockstar.\n\nAnyway, I remembered yesterday while driving along Gerrard. Must try Sully's, the reminder app in my brain tweeted. Parked in front of the joint so I wouldn't get confused again and ordered the po' boy AND the fries and sat inside. Great service (so cute were the guys), sandwich is HUGE, the battered shrimp is succulent and the slaw inside is fresh and crunchy, the bun is fluffy and fresh with NO sesame seeds! (please all sandwich joints need to stop with sesame seed buns, those little seeds ruin everything)...the fries are skinny French frite type, very elegant. So happy it's warm out now because there is a patio.\n\nI will come back and try every sandwich except for the tofu one, because no.
Well, PizzaBOGO is absolutely the most bold thing that has happened to Pizza since deep dish pizza. May be there are other things that have happened that I am not aware off, because I have not been to San Fransisco!! \n\nPizzaBOGO is locally owned pizza place in Cleveland or NE Ohio area. All of their meat is halal or kosher so that is a plus when you are ordering food for someone with religious restrictions. They have classic pizza and many different varieties. I have tried almost all of their sauces and they are delicious. They have some kind of offer everyday that makes this place desirable and economical for college students or people who feel like not cooking regularly. I have had many of my friends hooked on to this place after introduced only once. \n\nTheir customer service and wait time is right on. I have never had to wait too long for a pizza ever. Food quality has been consistent at all locations in Cleveland. A must visit place if you are hungry for pizza.
OMG! Living in Lakewood we have no shortage of quality pizza choices.  I like a full bodied sauce, a little spicy kick with generous sausage or pepperoni.  Generous but not over the top.  You know it when you see it.  Add mushrooms and the perfect combination is pure heaven!\n\nAnd I think I found Heaven!\n\nIf you get what I am saying and it clicks with you.....this is the place to go!
This isn't where you go when you want a plain pepperoni.  If you're in the mood for regular pizza, hit up your favorite chain.  But when you're in the mood for something different, check out the World specialty pizzas.  I think I have tried them all now and there wasn't a single one that wasn't good.  The Tuscan and the Milano are a couple of my personal favorites.  Almost invariably when I tell someone about it, I get a story about their favorite pizza place and why it's the best and why they only order from blah blah blah.  Then I make them try a BOGO pizza and they are instantly won over, and I get the \"damn, that's good!\" look that can only be properly delivered while your mouth is completely full of something delicious.  However, the World pizzas are a little pricy.  Your best bet is to get picked up on Tuesday or Wednesday to take advantage of the buy-one-get-one-half-off deal which nets you two World pizzas for $15.
I love this place. We have never had a bad pizza here. Like it says 2 for 1. Ingredients always fresh and choices excellent , they are always running specials. We eat the at least 3 times a month.   I recommend getting on their text message alerts to get the weekly specials right to your phone.
Pizza Bogo in Lakewood offers the best customer service hand down. Always extremely helpful and so knowledgeable about the product. The prices are really reasonable especially the twisty bread for $1! Wonderful and interesting options!
Took an hour and 20 minutes to get a cold disgusting pizza... They used to be so good...
I come here every week... love it! It's just like every other Chipotle... only thing bad about this location is that their patio is rather small, I felt crammed.
Stale chips,  phoned ahead was not ready,  only had 2 people on the line.  Why are they so slow . Because  they need more people. Working. Bad management
Possibly not the cleanest place. I was violently ill after eating here, and I found out days after that a friend found a \"worm\" in her chicken bowl, i'm not sure how that happens, possibly in the lettuce?  but I would be careful.
It's Chipotle. I don't need to tell you about that.\n\nCan't speak to the past, but for the past 6 months this place has been fast, clean and did I mention fast? They've got a good team over there right now and I have yet to be skimped on anything. Good location as of 9/2014.
I have a soft spot for Bodega but honestly, I had the worst entree there last week. It was supposed to be Risotto, and I feel responsible 1. for ordering it - what was I thinking?  2. for not sending it back - we were with guests; we were in a hurry; I second guessed myself - 'maybe it's just me' . \nThe risotto was white  rice combined with halved plum tomatoes and sundried tomatoes sitting on top of a runny, pungent olive brine sauce.   I've never seen a risotto like this. For starters it wasn't an arborio-style rice, and as far as I could tell it hadn't been cooked in the stock.  It was as if the cook had no idea what risotto was.    No idea!  It was horrible.  Sorry Bodega. I should have sent it back and saved you the bad review . . . but how is it that you ever let it out of the kitchen?  In the past, I've had a lunch meal that was as good as this one was bad.  Two different cooks?
This place is a dump. The room smelled. The food was limp and burned. Never again. Stay away.
Went to Bodega last week for brunch and thought it was average at best.  For a pricey downtown bistro, the service here is lagging behind its competitors. One person in our group had to send his food back because it was cold. That's fine, mistakes happen, but the waiter acted like he would rather be at the dentist's office than tending to our table. Hopefully he was just having a rough morning but it was off-putting all the same, especially considering what we paid for our meal. I ordered Eggs Benny which wasn't bad but also nothing to write home about. If you're looking for Eggs Benny that will truly knock your socks off, stop by Carens in Yorkville or Amore in midtown.
Came here -first time - for dinner to try the summerlicious 2017 menu. The restaurant has a nice patio and is located in an interesting area of town. Inside it is a bit dark and the room is split into two. We were on the left side next to the bar. Food was excellent and nicely presented:\n-warm calamari w/ sundried tomatoes and olives-cooked perfectly that one of my guests was wondering what they did to have the calamari that soft\n-wellington county beef, yukon gold frites, shallot butter-I had my meat cooked rare as I wanted  (not medium rare or medium when I asked for rare!) but it was not as tender I thought it would be. Still it tasted great. I did not notice the shallot butter. Mine had onion compote/caramelised onion? instead\n-raspberry creme brulee-which was ok and I was very distracted by my guest's chocolate & espresso brownie!\n\nMy guests ordered the bouillabaisse and grilled chicken supreme which they commented were excellent.\n\nService was fast, the free bread really good,warm and fluffy and the meal was complemented by a nice glass of Malbec. Overall nice food and I look forward to coming back even to try the regular menu.
This is really a hidden gem. Best date place!\n\nI left my ring on the bathroom counter and only realized two hours later. I called, expecting to hear the usual \"no we haven't seen it, sorry\", but boy was I wrong! A lovely lady named Robin put me on hold while she went and checked if it was still there! Are we in Toronto? And to my relief, she said that she found it! Unbelievable. I am so impressed by the integrity and class of Bodega's patrons and staff. \n\n1. Very cozy and romantic atmosphere. Classy crowd and lovely music. Great ambiance. \n\n2. Great service. Our waiter was a very nice and charming fellow, I think that he may be one of the owners. He took our order quickly and we didn't have to wait long for our drinks and courses. \n\n3. Winterlicious menu was fabulous. We got the crab cakes, lamb, salmon, mousse, and blueberry bread pudding. Everything was delicious and Presentation was beautiful. The only thing that wasn't very impressive was the goat cheese salad...it was a little small and I couldn't taste the raspberry vinaigrette. The goat cheese was splendid though. My date loved the blueberry pudding dessert. Upon trying a bit of it (it was originally mine) he immediately traded with me. I was really full so I didn't mind, the mousse was light and perfect.\n\n4. The portions are proportionate! I was full by dessert! \n\n5. The wine was lovely. We had the merlot and the Pinot grigio I think.
I went to Bodega today for the first time. We were supposed to be eating Brunch, but the person who accepted the booking didn't inform the lady who made the booking that there would be no brunch because of Winterlicious, despite being asked to confirm that a brunch menu would be available.\n\nLuckily, their Winterlicious menu looked good. I ordered the Beet Salad, the Grilled Salmon & the Banana Cake.\n\nThe Beet salad was very good & the seasoning was perfect.\n\nThe Grilled salmon was nice, but there was very little sauce and a lot of lentils, which made it an average dish. (I tried the beef that my partner had ordered and it was pretty good.)\n\nThe Banana cake with Toffee sauce was ok. It was too sweet and rich for my liking.\n\nThe portions were good & overall the food was a 3.5 stars.\n\nThe reason I am giving it 2 stars is that the service wasn't great. It took the staff about 20 minutes to take our order. We were the first people in the restaurant and were a large group. At the time we were seated there was nobody else in there.\n\nI had to leave early for a play and so went to our server and asked her to give me a bill for my portion. She told me it wasn't easy to get my bill because it was a group and that's how the software worked and that it would take her a couple of minutes to print it out. Nearly 10 minutes later, I was still standing there, waiting for her to get my bill while she passed by me several times and went to other tables.\n\nI realise that the place was busy, but 10 minutes to get the bill for someone who has told them that they have to catch a play, is just ridiculous. There was also no apology and finally someone from our group volunteered to pay my bill and asked me to pay her back later. \n\nI will definitely avoid Bodega. While the food is not bad, the service clearly needs improvement.
Went here for the happy hour specials. There were maybe 4 people in the entire place yet we waited 20 mins for a server to take our drink order. He may or may not have been stoned or drunk. Very inattentive- he walked away as we tried to order food.\nThe food arrived and the portions were VERY small. One bite crab cakes for $8 and a crostini drizzled in balsamic for $7.
Never a bad experience.  This place is my boyfriend's fav restaurant in this city and I see why.  My favourite part of their set up is the wine pairings that go with your different courses.  Please go here!  It is great!
My boyfriend and I went the first time for winterlicious, and although we had to wait quite a while for our table to be ready (even with a reservation), the food and service was so good that we forgave all. He still remembers the duck confit with garbanzo beans and craves it on a regular basis, I remember my creme brulee -- yum.\nIt also has a nice clean, romantic atmosphere, great for a date. The wine list is good, and their brunch (steak and eggs) is to die for. I could go here again, and again, and again.
We came here as part of Winterlicious, and it was one of the best meals i've had in Toronto. \n\nFirst, the atmosphere was absolutely wonderful, we sat very close to the live fire place, in a cozy, warm and french environment. The soup of the day was wonderful especially with the great nutty fresh bread that Bodega served it with. For my main I had the duck confit with white beans and sausage that was delightful (i'm not even a fan of sausage). My date had the Beef Bourguignon that stuffed him well but was also delicious. Bodega did a great job of pairing our meals with nice wines as well. The dessert was probably the weakest link, in the form of a fairly standard chocolate mousse but it was good. \n\nOverall between the atmosphere, the friendly service and the great food it was a great Winterlicious experience and a place I'm surely to frequent a lot.
I love the location and the staff and the menu and the patio. But all the food was ho hum. Nothing terrible, but all of it was lacklustre. We tried scallops, poutine, beet salad and crab cakes.  Meh. It felt as if a line cook from TGI Friday was subbing in and doing a decent job of getting food out in time.
Came with my group on the weekend for Winterlicious Lunch . The service  experience was excellent..  We  tried a bit of each others dishes .Now for an evaluation of the dishes ordered:\n\nSTARTERS\n\nSweet & Bitter Greens: Hearty salad with a healthy variety of greens and vinaigrette.\n\nRabbit & Pistachio Terrine:  Everything blended perfectly in this dish . Enjoyed it and you should too.  My only concern was that the crostini could have  been just a little softer   as it is easier to chew, and handle on the plate with cutlery. Otherwise a perfect start to the meal.\n\nMAINS\n\nchicken breast 'coq au vin': This dish  while presented well  but was a bit too dry . Considering it is supposed to be braised in wine, there was not much of a wine taste in it.  Do not order it \n\nduck confit & succotash: The duck  has a crispy skin, and very soft meat . The succotash  complemented the duck well . Order this  and enjoy it \n\nDESSERT\n\nbanana bread pudding :   Was decent. Banana flavour could have been a bit  stronger  considering it is a banana bread pudding. More r\u00e8me anglaise & toffee sauce should be added so the pudding can be eaten easier.\n\nberry cobbler:  Well presented and  tasted nicely . Was a bit difficult to work with when trying to scoop a piece to eat. Dont order it  \n\nI recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try. I would have loved to try the dinner but I like to try new things  and for a return trip the quality of some of the dishes needs to  improve .
I took my wife there for a special evening. I have to admit I was a bit nervous about the French menu. We usually prefer experimenting, and the idea of an evening of traditional (read: stuffy) French cuisine had me wondering.\n\nI shouldn't have worried. My wife had a wonderful pairing menu, and I opted to pick and choose from the main menu.\n\nEverything food wise was wonderful. The flat iron steak was out of this world, done exactly as I had requested it.\n\nThe wine selection was superb, and I even managed to find a Chilean wine I had 5 years ago and forgot. The manager brought out the bottle for me to confirm the vintage after I told him the story with no coaxing from me.\n\nThe staff was polite, happy and attentive. We were served by three people over the course of a 3 hour evening, all them in great spirits and knowledgeable of the menu and cellar.\n\nThe atmosphere was wonderful. The front room is small, seating about 35 people in th living room of an old Toronto estate house. The conversation was alway audible if you listened, but easy to tune out with your own. Laughter carries across the room.\n\nWe will be going back.
Came here with a party of 4 on a Friday evening around 8:30pm hoping for a quick meal after visiting someone at Mount Sinai. We chose here mainly because it looked somewhat busy and they have a nice-sized patio. I was a bit discouraged seeing the low rating on Yelp, but thought we would give it a try anyways. To begin, the waiter tried to be helpful but couldn't really answer some of our questions about the menu. After we ordered it took at least 30-45 min to get our food, and the food itself was very mediocre and very overpriced. $22 for a simple Cobb salad with sparse ingredients is ridiculous, though the chicken was well-cooked. We also ordered the calamari appetizer which was rubbery and didn't taste fresh. The best part of the meal was the side of fries, as they were crispy and decadent. There was a loud wedding inside the restaurant, and many of the guests were hanging around outside, blocking the doorway that the staff use to bring out food from the kitchen, shouting and swearing. Overall, definitely wouldn't go back. There are much better places in Baldwin Village (Kinton probably being the best, but a better choice when it's cold outside).
What a horrible experience! We are SO disappointed. I have no complaints about the food as it was above average but the service was the WORST I've seen.\n\nThe first impression was great: cute neighbourhood, convenient location (we walked from Kensington Market), cozy setting. \n\nUpon entering the restaurant, our waiter lead us to our table. A few minutes later when he came back to hand out our menus, he did not introduce himself as our waiter nor welcome us to the restaurant. He actually did not even SAY A WORD to us until our full party arrived 20 minutes later and he came to take our order. Again, no introductions nor welcoming us nor explaining the menu... he was simply taking our order. He was dressed differently than the other waiters so we wonder if he is the manager. There was another server who gave us our bread and he was friendly and smiling.\n\nWe are a party of 6 and we ordered from the Winterlicious menu on Sunday. We were told the duck confit was sold out, but it was nice that they had a streak frites substitution. Our reservation was for 1:00pm and the waiter took our order at around 1:20pm but by 2:30pm, our entrees have not arrived yet. We had to flag down our waiter and ask why our food was taking so long. He explained that there was a large group who ordered before us and the kitchen was taking care of their orders. That's bull... we watched other tables who arrived AFTER us who got their entrees BEFORE us. They even got duck confit!!! I understand the kitchen can get busy but our best guess is they forgot our order.\n\nOnce our food finally arrived, it was around 2:45pm, more than an hour after our order was taken. The steak came out too charred but the trout was flaky and yummy. Our waiter finally talked to us again and asked if everything was fine... but this was AFTER we had finished the food on our plates. After another wait for our dessert, we FINALLY finished our meal at 3:30pm. \n\nWhen the bill came, there was a mandatory charge of 20% tips (because of our party of 6). This was absolutely fine IF service was better but we were forced to pay that amount for bad service. I do not recommend Bodega to ANYONE after we were treated SO poorly.
I went here for brunch before going to the AGO. It was a Sunday around 11:30 and the restaurant was empty! The waitress was extremely nice. The food was amazing. I had the goat cheese salad. It was creamy and delicious. We followed that with crab cakes (which are full of crab - they aren't too bready) and pan seared scallops. The scallops were to die for. So good! All-in-all it was a great meal.
Came here for Summerlicious, and it was the best experience I've ever had! So good I had to come twice to try out the other items on the menu. For the appetizer I tried both the blue crab cakes and the salad--both delicious but the crab cakes are absolutely amazing. Piping hot with crunchy crusts, it was delicious served with the tomato salsa on the side. For the entrees I had the duck the first time and the lamb chops the second time. The meat on both were tender and succulent and cooked to perfection. Portion sizes were very decent and the side vegetables pair very well with both dishes. Finally for dessert I tried the triple chocolate mousse and creme brulee. The mousse was thick and rich and delicious. Only complaint I had was that the custard of the creme brulee was very thin, as if it was a heavy cream instead of a custard. All in all the food was superb, and the service was top notch!
It's a worth mentioning that this review is solely based on my Winterlicious experience and may or may not reflect the quality of their regular food/service.\n\nThe atmosphere is good. You sense that this establishment has history in this space. Dimly light, warm and cozy vibes with signature white table cloths and rustic chandeliers. The stage is set and seems like it's going to be a refine meal with impeccable service. However, the truth is quite far from what they appear to be.\n\nWhilst the service was adequate I wouldn't necessarily compliment it. There's the usual \"hello, how are you? Can I take your order?\" and.... that's where it ends. There was no offer to refill our beverages even though we had emptied them before we were on to our main. No concerns regarding how our meal was. No small talk/chit-chat/jokes....not even a smile. And last but not least...no goodbyes or thank yous. No, it wasn't busy like a flea market, it was just a casual Wednesday evening. That in there sums up the experience. Perhaps, and I hope this is just restricted to Winterlicious.\n\nOn to the food. It was forgettable at best and some of it was not great. Beef cheek was overcooked/over-charred. My fish was well-well-done. In fact, that is probably the theme of the meal \"well-well done\". Seafood -- well-well done. The only saving grace might have been the peach dessert and the creme brulee(but who messes this up anyways?).\n\nAll in all, a very forgettable experience not worthy of my time.
I like Bodega's. I have been several times for lunch. Food has always been good and the atmosphere is very conducive for lunch meetings. A quick hop from the discovery district.
After searching for a good French restaurant we made a reservation at Bodega for lunch.  \nDelicious food, nice and polite waiters, and pleasant atmosphere. The next time we will go back there for brunch.
A group of us came to bodega for lunch during work. The restaurant was about 30% full so we got seated right away - and then it all went downhill.\n\nWe got $23 prix fixe which is a good deal considering the mains range from about $15-$25. I ordered:\n\n- roasted beet salad\n- beef bourguignon\n- warm banana cake with toffee sauce. \n\nMy workmates ordered the calamari salad, the salmon, cassoulet, and creme brulee.\n\nFirstly the food is just.. meh. I have never had such unexciting french food. It all was lack luster, required some salt and just a little bit more care. The beef bourguignon was good but I could have made it at home. It needed more wine to add depth. \n\nI tried my friends cassoulet  - just awful. The dessert was good but not great. \n\nI could overlook the bland food if the service was good - however we were there for 2 hours!! It took forever and considering the restaurant wasn't busy and we ordered off of the prix fixe menu it makes no sense. \n\nOverall the food here can be made by any average home cook, and you won't have to spend two hours sitting hoping your meal will eventually come.
The best option in that Baldwin block for good food. Came today for the last day of Winterlicious, and it was delicious, really excellent value for money! \n\nFor starters, I had Moules Marini\u00e8re which were flavorful and the mussels were nicely cooked. My friend had roasted bell pepper soup which was really excellent from what I heard.\n\nFor the main I had the Cassoulet with Duck Confit, the white beans served with it was perfectly cooked to my liking, not hard and not mushy so it retained texture, it was soft but not falling apart if that makes any sense, the bacon and sausage in the beans gives the beans a nice flavor The duck confit was nicely done, it was falling off the bone tender yet not dry, it was just a bit too salty for my liking. My friend had the Grilled Atlantic Cod and the cod was nicely cooked with a great crust. The portion sizes for the duck and cod were generous yet, another friend had ravioli (not a winterlicious item) and he got maybe 6 raviolis which I heard was \"not very good\". 6 raviolis for $17 is not that great.\n\nFor dessert, I had Duo of Raspberry and Orange Sorbet, which was average, nothing to write home about, might be a bit tooo sweet and it was a bit melted when it arrived.\n\nOverall the restaurant generally serves good food for the price range it is being judged at. The service is always pretty good, service is prompt and non-intrusive. This restaurant is 5 starts for Winterlicious because the value to quality ratio is very high, under normal circumstances, it is a 4 since some of the items I had tried before were just ok for this price range. It is definitely the best option on Baldwin if you want to have a nice meal though.
We went to Bodega for Valentines Day and it was fabulous.  We had a reservation, however they were completely swamped and behind on seating guests, but to be expected ona busy night like Valentines Day.  The staff were apologetic and offered everyone free sparkling wine until the tables were ready, a very thoughtful touch.\nWe had the froie gras and grilled quail for appetizers, and the lamp shank and veal chop for mains.  Everything was fantastic and thoroughly delicious.  The food was warm, presented nicely and the taste was amazing.  We had warm maple pudding and flourless chocolate cake for dessert, and the chocolate cake was incredible.  I have no idea how they made it, but it was just amazing.  The maple pudding was fantastic as well, but its hard to compete with this chocolate cake.  The wine list was quite extensive for bottles, but I would have like to have seen more options for glasses or half liters.  \nAll in all Bodega is a high-quality restaurant that will satisfy foodies, but still remains reasonably priced.  Very highly recommended!
This place looked pretty nondescript on the outside as far as restaurants are concerned and it probably wouldn't have stood out as a nice place to eat to some random passerby. I strolled in on a Saturday afternoon hoping for the $20 prix fixe lunch, but apparently they only serve that on weekdays. Instead, I ordered the French toast off their brunch menu. It came loaded with berries, banana slices, whipped cream, and maple syrup - yummy! The portion size and flavour were fantastic for the price.\n\nFor those with allergies, their menu has a warning that they use peanut oil for a lot of recipes, so make sure to ask ahead.\n\nThe place was absolutely dead that afternoon and I chatted it up for quite a bit with the Bobby the super nice waiter. I promised him I'd come back for lunch in a few days but unfortunately I was too broke by then. :( Ah well, if I ever roll back in town!
I organized a girls lunch for a warm Saturday afternoon.  Bodega was not our first choice - none of us had been there. We were actually scheduled to go to One in Yorkville. \nAfter re-evaluating menu's and reviews, we decided to go with Bodega. I cannot stress what a perfect choice Bodega was.\n\nFrom the moment we walked the restaurant row of Baldwin Village, to the steps of Bodega, it was bliss. The patio seating for our group was perfect.  We were seated in a corner of the patio with greenery for privacy. The service from the get go was neutral. It wasn't overly friendly but it was not bad. Throughout the lunch I suppose the waitress warmed up to us. \n\nThe waitress was very patient with the 5 of us, through our orders. The food was brought up in unison, which is always amazing. Each course was well portioned, and delicious. I had gone for the mussels to start - about 8 mussels.  Very tasty sauce, and clean mussels. My main was the trout, which was crusted and beautifully presented. My dessert was the fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream. Overall it was an absolute value for 3 courses PLUS a mimosa for $23.00. We kept ordering drinks and chatting well after lunch, embarrassingly it went on for about 8 hours...in turn it became dinner time! (We walked over to Chinatown for that!).  We were never asked to move, never felt hurried to leave, even though many walk-in's were seen entering the patio area. Did I mention after she brought the bill as one total, she quickly acted on breaking up the bill upon request?  \n\nOverall, it was the perfect choice as stated before. Food 4 stars, service 4 stars. And it was not that the food or service was that outstanding. It was not innovative food, it was not cutting edge modern fusion.  This is a traditional French Cuisine restaurant. It was the simplicity of the fresh food and amicable service that worked together.
Dining Experience: Birthday Celebration. Who's? MINE :) \nVenue: Bodega\nSpecialty: French\nMenu items:  French Onion Soup Gratinee and Pan Seared Scallops with Prawn Ravioli.\nWine Pairing: Italian Pinot Grigio \n\nFrench cuisine is amongst the most celebrated types of cuisines in the world. Is delicate, yet rich; buttery, yet balanced and it does not make you fat. Ok, the last statement is probably not 100% true, but according to best selling author, Mireille Guiliano, French women don't get fat!   And that my foodies, its true.  Because its all about food portion control, and a place like Bodega with the decent size portions validates this.\n\nBodega is a restaurant located in the famous Baldwin street, which really consists of an almost half a block strip stuffed with 10 or so restaurants.  I believe Baldwin to be a very unique street with tons of good variety.  If you are foodie, you will know about this street for sure.\n\nI started my lovely French meal with a staple, French onion soup.  \nThe soup's recipes, to my knowledge, is one of the easiest to make. Getting the ingredients to balance in one's palette, is a whole other thing.  This soup was perfection - not too salty, not too oily and with the right balance of onions.  I was very happy my meal had a great start.\n\nNext, I had the Ravioli appetizer as a main. One of the neat things about Bodega is that you can turn any appetizer into a entree, so I did.\nThe ravioli was extremely fresh and was stuffed with the prawns. The scallops where hanging around next to them and drizzled with a lovely Saffron cream sauce.  If I can add, I am a saffron fan and if I find this ingredient in any restaurant menu, I am most likely to order that dish...just because of the saffron, yum! Any who, the ravioli was topped with crispy onions which gave it a nice touch and balanced the creaminess of the sauce to give it a crunchy texture.  I would highly recommend this dish.\n\nI would give this restaurant a 4/5.  To get to the 5, I would recommend adding some more French staples to the menu and improving the duck meat quality.
Hands-down, the best Summerlicious experience I've had, in four years of Licious-ing. Really, it's 4.5 stars. (When oh when are Yelp going to allow us to give half stars?!)\n\nCame here for a weekday lunch after being told to get lost by harried staff at Midi Bistro around the corner (more on that in my next review). Bodega's patio is simply beautiful: large, shady, looking onto the sweet Baldwin St cafe strip and all of its action on one side, and the gorgeous old vine-covered red brick Victorian on the other. Comfy banquettes with a back just high enough to drape your arm comfortably over. Honestly, patios don't come much better than this. Plus, there's proper silverware, napery and glassware.\n\nWe were seated and attended to straight away by our lovely server, a guy with a lilting West Indian accent, who was friendly but not intrusive, and totally attentive throughout, despite the busy lunch period--no waving the bill down here. Clearly, someone at Bodega knows that hiring enough staff (and good staff) is crucial to keeping customers happy, a very basic hospitality lesson that you would think more restaurateurs and pub owners would have grasped by now... amirite?\n\nThe Summerlicious lunch prix fixe is $20 and features a few tasty-looking options. I had a chilled filet of sole mousse with a red pepper sauce; confit of duck with sweet potato, bacon and rosemary hash and green beans; and orange creme brulee. My date had the soup du jour (a chilled cucumber puree); the grilled steelhead trout with israeli couscous; and warm berries with vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe food was a little inconsistent, but generally very good. The standout dishes were my duck confit and his berries and ice cream. I was worried about ordering duck confit and sweet potatoes on such a hot day (30+C), but it was a nice small portion and it was really delicious--rich, moist, crispy-skinned. The sweet potatoes were fantastic--the bacony-oniony sauce they came in made them incredibly more-ish. His trout was a little overcooked, but the couscous was studded with raisins and pine nuts for interest, and pretty yum. My chilled sole mousse was a little blah, but he wolfed down his chilled cucumber soup, which was light, minty, and very refreshing. My creme brulee was beautifully executed: it had a lovely brittle crunchy top which was super-fun to crack with my spoon, and a nice delicate orange flavour. His dessert was outstanding: I don't know what they did to those berries--or maybe they are just perfectly in season right now--but they were the berriest-tasting berries I've ever eaten! A nice mix of strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries. Yummmmm.\n\nAgain, though, the things that really made it for me were the gorgeous surroundings, and the superlative service. Last night I was at The Rhino in Parkdale, where I waited literally forty-five minutes--no exaggeration--to get a lukewarm pint of beer. Here, I had a glass of beautifully chilled, crisp prosecco in my hand within eight minutes of sitting down. LOVE. IT.\n\nBodega is one of the (sadly very few) restos that know how to do Summerlicious right: don't cheap out, hire enough staff to cover the busy times, and make sure the food is impressive and done with care, not prefabricated crap that you're cranking out and trying to pass off as something fancy. I would definitely say that I've had more bad experiences than good during Summerlicious and if anything it has been most useful in weeding out the places I definitely won't go again. This, however, is not one of them. Well-played, Bodega!
First things first: service is terrible here. My brother and mother took me here for my birthday last night and we ordered from the Winterlicious menu. \n\nThe waiters are cold. One offered to level out our table and our orders were taken fast. However, the food took a while to arrive. I had the blue crab cakes (it was delicious), the baked chicken (ok- I can get much better chicken at Ruth's Chris and really should've gone there) and for dessert, the mango pudding and vanilla ice cream. Portion sizes were good and I must admit that I was mighty full after the meal.\n\nOverall, I'd give the food a 4/5. HOWEVER, any tastiness in the food was overshadowed by the terrible service. My brother, mother and I finished our appetizers and main courses and we literally sat there for 10 minutes after each course with our empty dishes left in front of us. This is even though at least two waiters walked by and saw the empty dishes. \n\nOur water was refilled once (refilling being the mark of great service) and only because my brother asked the waiter for it. NO ONE came to ask how the food was- NOT EVEN ONCE. When it came time to pay, we were charged for 4 Winterlicious patrons when there were clearly only 3 of us and when my brother pointed this out, there was not even an apology.\n\nI've patronized many restaurants that partake in the Winterlicious event over the years and this is the first time that I've had a bad experience and on my birthday no less. It's pretty idiotic of them as if i were a restaurant, I'd use the Winterlicious event to market to potential customers. Way to leave a bad impression on potential customers. Never returning to this place and taking my business and network of friends and colleagues elsewhere.
Outstanding.\n\nThe seared scallop and shrimp ravioli appetizer is pretty phenomenal.  The lamb shank entree is delicious.
For a fine dining establishment, it didn't measure up to my expectations. French onion soup had stiff cheese, not melted enough. I enjoy rare steak but their steak was too tough. I had to leave some not-so-pretty chewed up bits on the plate. And the service was sub par; they forgot who's plate is who, plus they weren't very attentive to when we finished or bothered to ask if we were. I can see how the decor makes it good for romantic evenings, but I wouldn't make this a prospective date place since I'm disappointed with the food.
I went yesterday with a group of professionals after I selected this establishment. I had high hopes for this restaurant. Sadly I was disappointed. \n\nLocation: At one end of Keningston Market, this place is easy to find and features outdoor setting. It's a great part of the city in my opinion with tons of eclectic buildings and people all around. So a pro just difficult to reach if you are driving!\n\nThe Interior: It's pretty however, very tight. If I stretched out my arm I could touch the bar and that wasn't very pleasant especially whenever a server passed by with drinks since they splashed all over one of my fellow diners.\n\nThe Food: Lackluster. The only good thing was the crab cake filling. The exterior was over fried and oily, the tomato provencale was tasted too make of oil, the aioli was subpar. I ordered the grilled salmon which was overcooked and the saffron rice was covered in an oily dressing which was unpleasant. Those who had the duck confit told me it was dry as was the rack of lamb. Dessert was a disaster of creme brulee custard cooked to scrambled eggs, bread pudding as hard as rock and chocolate cake that refused to slice! \n\nThe Service: If you are a server and you really hate your job I don't know what to tell you besides don't take it out on your customers. We were ignored for 30 minutes regardless of us requesting to be serviced. We would make eye contact or beckon to our waitress who promptly made a face and turned around and walked away. I was perched by the end of the night only receiving a water refill once that night and the glass was small!  Waiting for the food was ridiculous. To get an appetizer: 30 minutes, a main: 45 minutes, dessert: 30 minutes. How the dining experience went on so long is based solely on poor service and bad food. \n\nI would not recommend this restaurant unless you are famished and you don't want to wait a long line up for ice cream instead. And even then I would avoid.
WOW! That's all I have to say about this little gem of a place! A couple friends and I went here a few days ago and had an incredible time! This place was hopping with Christmas parties all around and the service still was amazing! The servers were all so attentive, despite being busy with all the other people in the place. The food was great. So well portioned and the taste was to die for! Such a great atmosphere, friendly service and great food. I will definitely be returning here and I highly recommend you give this place a try! :)
Tried this place on Winterlicious. Fair price for its environment, location and food quality. I did not particular like the salad but the rabbit leg turned out to be good.
Me and my companion went to Bodega for their Winterlicious 2014 Prix Fixe Dinner. Having a relatively forgettable experience at another restaurant for Winterlicious 2012, we skipped out on 2013 and hoped to turn things around for this year. Bodega ended up providing a fine experience overall with mostly good food, but a few problems here and there.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant was elegant - dim lights, white linens and all. The staff was courteous and did not make us feel the least bit out of place inside. The noise level was moderate, not intimate - as a large party was in the other room.\n\nI ordered the Warm Goat Cheese Salad as an appetizer, Slow Roasted Beef Short Ribs for the main and the Almond Pear Tart for dessert. My partner had the French Onion Soup for an appetizer, the Grilled Fillet of Atlantic Salmon for a main and the Bread Pudding for dessert.\n\nAs a whole, one of the biggest issues I had during my experience with Winterlicious 2012 was the portion sizes being much too small - an app the size of an amuse, the main the size of an app, et cetera. At Bodega, I found the portion sizes much more appropriate for a dinner, leaving me full but not bloated. \n\nThe complimentary bread was warm, hearty and had a nice crusty exterior. I ate it without the butter provided and was quite happy with how it was made - likely baked the same day (though I'm not sure if it was baked in-house or bought from a local bakery).\n\nI love cheese. Just having the warm goat cheese salad in the menu was a slam dunk in pleasing me. The salad came with a few raspberries which visually popped and provided a nice sweetness and freshness to counterbalance the richness of the cheese and tartness of the vinaigrette. There were mixed microgreens, sprouts and a large slice of just-to-the-point-of-almost-melting goat cheese on top of it all. The salad was delicious but was just slightly imbalanced for my taste.\n\nThere were maybe three or four berries for the whole salad, causing me to portion them to ensure I had some of it in every bite. On the other side of the equation was the slice of goat cheese: it was quite large - I had a full quarter of the cheese leftover after I finished all the greens.There were also bacon bits, but they tasted quite ordinary and felt as though they were added to make the dish more familiar to people who don't eat fine dining. I finished it all, and it was ultimately a delicious plate of food that could've been a bit more polished.\n\nI tried a bit of the french onion soup and it probably just wasn't my cup of tea. The onion was strong and the melted cheese was strong, but the soup itself was very thin which felt strange to my palette. Perhaps with a slice of baguette to sponge up the soup or additional textural components and my opinion of it would be better.\n\nMy main was absolutely delicious - the jus was flavorful and plentiful. The meat was completely tender and well portioned - not to the point of belonging to a steakhouse or smokehouse but large enough for a proper meal. It came with some great vegetables with a nice balanced mix of tartness and sweetness and varying textures. The garlic mashed potatoes were nothing special, but nothing bad - loads of butter and a great creaminess and acted as a fine canvas to the other ingredients. Texturally engaging, flavorfully complex and well portioned, this main was divine.There were a few tiny bones throughout the meat, due to the nature of the cut of meat, but wasn't a particularly troubling issue for me.\n\nThe Almond Pear tart was served with a sabayon. The crust was thin but had a good snap to it. The portions of the tart with a bit of pear, almond and sabayon were a truly euphoric experience - something I would look forward to from the start of any meal. Unfortunately, those great bites were matched with equally dry and uninteresting bites of just almond and crust - with just a few slices of pear baked in and a paltry amount of sabayon served. If they were a bit more heavy handed with the sauce, things would have been perfect in my opinion, but the bites that chewed dry took away from the dessert as a whole. \n\nOverall, it was a memorable night with an experience that I don't get to have very often with my price range and personal preferences. Some moments of the night really were spectacular whilst others were slightly disappointing. The food was delicious but lacked a bit of balance - especially in the salad and dessert. I may be a bit nit-picky in the review, but as the price of a meal goes up, so does my expectations of it. It's a great experience to have once in a while, but I can't see myself financially or preferentially doing this too often.\n\n3.5 / 5, closer to a 4 than a 3.
Bodega is a cute restaurant in Baldwin village.  We visited on a Monday night so there was no wait for a table.  The servers were polite and attentive.  The menu, although small, caters to varied tastes.  I had the mushroom risotto and was really impressed with how creamy it was.  The calamari appetizer tasted lovely and wasn't too oily.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you happen to be in the area.
Went there for dinner today with my boyfriend after reading all the great reviews. I don't think I'll be going there again. The server was cold and impolite. After pouring my drink, I said thank you and he didn't even bother replying or smiling back or came by to ask how the food was. The food itself wasn't great either. Had the french onion soup. The cheese on top was too hard and soup too salty. Crab cake tastes really fishy and the interior is soggy. The steak in the steak frites was great though. Very tender and juicy, but the frites look and taste like those store bought frozen fries. We also had the vegetarian tower. It was okay, nothing special, we felt it's too greasy and lack in taste. I had creme brubee for dessert, it wasn't too sweet, so it paired with the sugar top perfectly, a good finishing touch to the dinner.
Location Location Location.... I love Baldwin Village... and what I love more is that there is never a lack of multicultural dining experiences... from Italian to Mexican, to Indian and to my favourite... French.\n\nI was introduced to Bodega by a friend after I was getting tired of the same restaurant options for date night. I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is very cozy.. almost like being in someone's dining room (it's in an old house).. The service was great and they had a prix fixe (roughly $30).. but not only that, they had a wine prix fixe... \n\nThe wine prix fixe essentially consisted of pairing a glass of wine with each meal. The only problem with this scenerio was that the next course would come before you could finish your wine = tipsy by the end of it!.\n\nI would recommend:\n\nStarters - Calamari Salad\nEntree- Flat Iron Steak and Frites (BEST Steak I have EVER had)\nDessert- Creme Brulee or Warm Banana Cake\n\nThis place is perfect for date night or for going with a small group of friends . ( I went with 5 people and we had a great table in a back corner by the fire place)\n\nBon Appetit!
We went in the dog-days immediately after New Year, and although quiet, the service and food were still of high quality.\nIt is exactly what you would expect from a good French Bistro. Good steak frites with excellent frites. Well executed salads and fine fish alternatives. Oh, and a lovely mushroom risotto, by the way.\nFull and reasonable wine list.
What started out as a torrential downpour Friday evening, it thankfully cleared up by 7pm just in time for our 8pm reservation.  In the heart of small Baldwin Village Bodega was a first time for all of us!  Dim, intimate, and classy Bodega is a hidden gem in this victorian style house.  The beautiful decor, crystal white table clothes, comfy seating, and ambience is the perfect setting for a beautiful evening.  Summerlicious menu had some great choices and here's my review!!\n\nescargot and sweetbreads 5/5\nfusilli, pommery mustard, brandy, tomato, and cream!!\nIve always wanted to try Escargot! and I'm glad I ordered it.  Perfect melody of flavors from the pommery mustard, cream, and brandy made this dish! and added some added flavor to the escargot! The fusilli was a nice addition to the dish, much like a mini pasta salad!\n\ngrilled alberta flat iron steak  4.5/5\nshallot butter and frites: Cooked to perfection....MEDIUM!.  Tender, and full of flavor! and as always a little butter goes a long way.  The homemade frites were so delish! a plate alone would have been yum....actually... an extra side order!\n\nstrawberry rhubarb tart with whipped cream 5/5\nWish I could have ordered a second serving!!! sort melt-in-your-mouth!....simply yum. \n\nThe service at first was a bit slow, but later on picked up his slack!! nonetheless a gem that I will definitely be visiting soon!
Came here for Summerlicious with 3 friends and we had a lovely evening. \n\nService 5/5 for the management staff. My friends and I had an 8:15 reservation (because that was the only one available) but wanted an earlier seating so we went around 6pm hoping we could wait for an earlier table but the restaurant was hosting a huge party that night and had very limited seating. The manager assured us he would do everything he could to get us seated sooner and sure enough, by 7:30 we had a beautiful spot on the patio.\n\nService 4/5 for our waitress. She was nice but not very attentive. One of my friends ordered the steak and fries and our waitress forgot to bring ketchup, even after my friend asked for it. We also had to constantly ask for our waters to be refilled. However the food came out at a really good pace and we had lots of time to eat and rest in between. \n\nFood 4/5: I started with the warm calamari which was tender and tasted great with the sun dried tomatoes, capers and lemon. For my main I had the bouillabaisse which was a small portion but the tomato broth was tasty. The scallops were a tad bit undercooked for my liking but very fresh. Salmon was the market fish and it was moist and flaky. For dessert i had the key lime which I didn't like that much. It wasn't tart enough for my liking. My friends started with the beet salad which was great although one of them didn't love the blue cheese. One of them also got the steak which was fine but nothing amazing. The fries however were really good, with a natural sweet taste. One of them also got the raspberry creme br?l\u00e9e which i liked better than the key lime. We also tried their raspberry lemonade and grape fruit elderflower fizz which were both perfect summer drinks! Light and refreshing, perfect for a hot day. \n\nAtmosphere 4/5: The patio is the perfect spot for a romantic date. It has lots of flowers, lights and comfortable seating. Inside was stark, plain and too hot as there was no c/a.
Looking at the menu and the physical space of the restaurant, my hubbys and I were excited to eat here. We were sorely disappointed in the mediocre food and uninterested service. My husband ordered off of the Summerliciious menu while I ordered off of the regular money:\n\n- To start off with, we never received any bread before our meal. Initially, we thought perhaps this a norm for THIS restaurant however during our entree course we saw another table munching on what looked like delicious, thick slices of hearty bread.\n- Our actual entrees (duck and fish) did not taste great especially when considering the price.\n- The waiter never bought me a dessert menu and showed up with a creme brulee that husband ordered at the beginning of our meal when ordering off the Summerlicious menu. The creme brulee was small but delicious but honestly creme brulee is hard to mess up.\n- One plus is that they offered a few tasty options for mocktails for those who don't drink alcohol.\nI would not come here again, waste of time, waste of money and better options in Toronto.
Great service, great food. Had escargot , grilled calamari and duck confit - shared all the meals (if I ordered the main, I probably wouldn't have been able to finish it). Atmosphere is cozy with eclectic decor and color you can sense this place has history. Desert - creme br?l\u00e9e and espresso. Desert was good, but comparable to other creme brulees I've had , as I am a fan of it.
Bodega is a great classy restaurant to take your significant other to, for a romantic date ;) Sadly, I didn't have a date and went with a couple of my girlfriends instead. BUT this sad story does have a happy ending as I tried this restaurant for the Summerlicious Event and it turned out to be an amazing dining experience for me. The food was cooked to absolute perfection to my liking. \nFor my complete trio lunch dining, I went with the Baked Goat Cheese Tart Nicoise, Duck Confit with Frites and a White Chocolate Mousse Cake. So here goes my narration.... The goat cheese tart was very unique in its texture as the tart was crispy/flakey and the cheese was very creamy. Definitely not what I expected but they tasted very good together. The duck confit was  juicy, flavorful and very tender - literally fall off the bone meat! It was all yums! Lastly with my desert, the chocolate mousse cake was excellent as it had the right amount of sweetness. It went well with the distinctive fruit flavoured coulis that were drizziled onto the cake (I think it was mango, raspberry... and I forgot the last one). But all and all, a great lunch experience as I was lucky to have a very attentive server. I left extremely satisfied.
Came here with friends for French food.\nDecent place, good service, food is pretty delicious\nPrice is pretty high, three people ~160$
The taste of the food may have been tainted by how utterly rude our waiter was. Greeted with a \"What do you want?\" we immediately regretted coming in. Anything we asked for, beverages, cutlery, we received no response from him and sometimes the request would be fufilled. Don't bother with Bodega.
Ho hum....I'm no fancy food expert.  I'm the type of person that would probably eat with my bare hands if I had to because well it's too fancy to use utensils....\n\nCame here for a staff christmas party two years ago.  Granted I'm no fancy food connoisseur by any means.  \n\nThey had a prix fix menu, I think I got some kind of fried scallop, main dish and creme bruele.\n\nI had steak and frites (that's fries for all you regular folk).  Steak was just ok, no HP sauce (see I told you I was food bumpkin!). \n\nFried scalop tasted like something lower end than red lobster, the breading was very oily.  The creme bruele was ok, had a nice crisp top.\n\nService was equally meh, our group wasn't that big maybe 15 people tops and I found the head waiter to be standoffish.  BTW, he wasn't the one I asked for HP sauce.\n\nGive me the keg anyday over this place for the price and value.
There food is really delicious. I come here for Winterlicious almost every year. No words to describe their food, you just really have to come and try it. A bit pricey, but this isn't a fast food shack anyways.
One of the few great restaurants in the downtown core that's opened on Sundays. Tucked away in a tiny strip of restaurants on Baldwin, Bodega is definitely a pleasant surprise. \n\nWe loved the cozy and quiet ambiance and it's a great date spot - it was relatively quiet on a rainy and Sunday night, and we're able to enjoy each other's company. The food was good at a very reasonable price, and the strawberry rhubarb tart was terrific. On top of that, service was top-notch - our waitresses were attentive and friendly, but also gave us some privacy at the right time. Definitely will recommend!
My friend booked a winterlicious lunch at this French restaurants for $23. There was 3 courses, Entree, Main Course and Dessert. For the Entree, we have a choice of soup of the day (creamy mushroom), Sweet and Bitter Green, Rabbit & Pistachio Terrine, and Escagot & Fussilli. I took the escagot, which was heavy due to the creamy rose sauce. In addition to the entree, I've ordered an extra French Onion Gratinee Soup for $10, which I wasn't too impress as I've tasted better but at least it kept me warm. For the main course, I've chose the Duck Confit & Cassoulet, which is a bowl with one duck leg. Loved the tenderness of the duck, but not a fan of the cassoulet. I've sampled my friend's Beef Bourguignon which tasted amazing. The other choices for the main course were the Grill Salmon and a Quiche Florentine. As for dessert, I've took the Chocolate Mousse over Creme Brulee and Pecan Tart. The mousse was soft like chocolate fudge. Overall I had a great experience.
My cousin had his engagement dinner here, so we had half the restaurant and bar to ourselves and much of the outside patio. \nI was really impressed. It was small and classy but it didn't feel try-hard or snobby at all. The bartenders were are really sweet and helpful. We all had a shot together at the end of the night! :)\n\nThe food was delicious!!!! Really nice place, I'd totally recommend it.
Went here with my boyfriend and best friend for her 20th birthday. First thing that I felt as we walked in, the servers didn't really take us seriously. Most of the patrons there looked a lot older than us(business folks). It took forever for our server to take our orders (even our drink orders) and the restaurant was relatively empty. \n\nWhen our food finally came, the portion sizes were on the smaller side. I was really shocked at the size of my boyfriend's steak though. It was minuscule! And to be honest, his plate didn't look good what so ever. Also, my paella was supposed to come with mussels but it came with chicken instead. Our server didn't inform me that they ran out of mussels when I ordered. \n\nThe ambiance is really nice though.
I was here for Valentine's day and the place was packed.  My boyfriend made a reservation at 8pm and there were still people coming in as we were leaving.  The restaurant was really nice, the decorate was beautiful.  The place was definitely fit for a romantic dinner.\nBesides the decor, the food was delicious too.  We started with the escargot appetizer which was really (I have never had it before).  For entree, we got the lamb and the eggplant with feta cheese tower.  The lamb was cooked to perfection and the eggplant and cheese was amazing too.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back for a special night out.  Recommended.
I chose Bodega for my department's Christmas Lunch at work; we have a large party and couldn't find anywhere that could accommodate our group and had a menu that everyone would enjoy. After some searching, I stumbled upon Bodega and the choice was made.\n\nBodega is a house that's been remodeled to be a restaurant. There are two front rooms and we sat in the larger one with the bar in it. I think bathrooms are in the basement but I didn't venture down there so I couldn't tell you!\n\nWe had a party of 11 for lunch so it took some time to get everyone's orders straightened away. The server was a bit aggressive in her approach to the table for the duration of the meal but that's probably just a personality thing. Our server was also the bartender, so she wasn't always paying attention when we needed drink refills or a new fork or something. \n\nI cannot go to a place like this and see poutine on the menu and NOT order it. WOW. OUT OF THIS WORLD. Soooo insanely good. If I hadn't been with my coworkers, I might have licked the plate clean. Such a delicious combination of mushrooms, cheese and fries. I ordered the lamb shank for lunch and again, OUT OF THIS WORLD. This lamb shank is the best I've ever had. It was smothered in some kind of delicious sauce with cranberry reduction and perched atop truffle mashed potatoes. A few of my coworkers tried the lamb shank and agreed that it was by far the best thing on the menu.\n\nI was happily surprised with Bodega; I was a bit worried with some of the mixed reviews that I saw online, but Bodega pretty much hit it out of the park. We did have one negative, one of the servers handed a plate to my boss and it ended up burning his hand. It was an unfortunate occurrence, and I'm not sure if the restaurant did anything to make up for it, but otherwise, the meal was very good and everyone enjoyed. I look forward to coming back to Bodega again and perhaps trying that lamb shank again... excuse me while I drool onto my keyboard.
Food was decent and atmosphere was great. However, the only thing that this place lacks is their service. \n\nMy friend recently brought in a birthday cake with macarons on top; however, some ended up missing somewhere, presumably someone who works in the kitchen's stomach. They tried using the excuse that it might've been chopped up and scattered on the cake. The thing is though, nobody at the table had even one bit of the \"chopped up\" macarons.\n\nMacaron thief much?
Good french restaurant. Portions are not big, but not too petite.\nThe patio is amazing.\nThe service was great! Don't know the name of our waiter (blond girl,) but she was attentive, patient and nice.
Great French restaurant on Baldwin st with a very sweet patio! It's a nice lunch spot for me since I work in the area and it's never super busy, although reservations are recommended. \n\nRecently dropped in for their lunch summerlicious menu which was excellent. Had their trout dish which was amazing, cooked perfectly! \n\nThey have great drink specials during the week as well. Worth stopping by if you're in the area!
Disclaimer: I came here first time for Summerlicious 2013 with two others.\n\nWow, the apps were good and the mains were amazing. The sweet and bitter salad was really great; a great mix of the two flavours. The rainbow trout melted in your mouth, and the duck confit was good as well. Flavours were not too subtle, but not too rich either; just right. Everyone was really happy with their apps and mains.\n\nI will say that if I had to pay regular price, I wouldn't be so impressed with their desserts or drinks. I ordered a mimosa ($8) and someone ordered soft mojito ($11). They were both not very good, and the portion was really small (mimosa came in a very skinny glass, and was portioned for like, 4 small gulps), so a double whammy on both drinks. \n\nThe desserts were also very simple; not like \"awesome because it was so simple and amazing\", but like, \"just simple and meh\". Like I said, I think this place has good appetizer and great mains, but not so much for dessert and specialty drinks.\n\nWe sat on the patio, and it was really cute; birds singing, music playing, leaves and twigs falling on to our table, which made us giggle. The bee was pretty scary, but I seriously recommend the patio.\n\nServer was very busy, so we understood that he wasn't always there. He apologized on his own and he was very courteous. Left a great tip, because I think service at regular times would be fantastic.
My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice Sunday dinner.  We stumbled along Bodega as we made our way down Baldwin.  From the outside it looks very fancy but we were greeted warmly and the light, fun music set the tone for our delicious dinner.  The prix fix menu was well worth the $35, the food was delicious, beautifully presented and the service was impressive.\nI would definitely go back.
It was very average to not that great. My friend ordered from the prix fixe menu and didn't like any of the courses. He couldn't even finish the steak because it was so tough. I ordered from the regular menu and got the French onion soup and lamb shank. The cheese on the soup was burnt and ruined the taste of the soup. At least the shank was ok. Definitely have had better. \n\nThe worst part is that when we were done we had to wait a looong time just to pay.  The waiter decided that he would help the group next  to us first.  BUT it was like 8 people all with individual checks and everyone paying with a credit card. So it took like 20 minutes for him to finish. Ridiculous. \n\nI guess it would be ok if you want to pay a lot for average food and slow service.
So I'm fairly new to Toronto and thus very new to Winterlicious...This little place was my first stop on the Winterlicious road and it was flat out AMAZING! \n\nI really enjoyed everything about Bodega; the area was cute, the restaurant was decorated in a very timeless classy manner, the food was topnotch and the price wasn't! Really what more do you want? In addition to the food, the wine suggestions my the waitstaff were spot on. This is a great date spot or just a nice place to have a weekend lunch or dinner that's dependably awesome!
I ordered the Eggs Florentine With Smoked Salmon on Toasted English Muffin With Two Poached Eggs, Spinach, Smoked Salmon, And B\u00e9arnaise Sauce for $13. I know, you are shocked with what I ordered. Yes, that was sarcasm. I tend to always order the same thing for brunch. I was a bit confused when this dish was placed in front of me. Never have I had this combination of sides for brunch. Side of fingerling potatoes, pickled cabbage and baby bok choy. Individually I like these sides, but together, specially with a creamy main, it just did not work. I did not have any inkling that I would be receiving these sides with my main. If I did, I definitely would have gone with fries. I was surprised that I did not like the fingerling potatoes. They just did not taste right. I can't pinpoint exactly what was wrong with them. Inasmuch as I was confused by the sides, I was overall satisfied with my Eggs Florentine. Though, I was thinking the craziest thing when eating my main; it had too much smoked salmon. I know, who thinks that?! There is usually never enough salmon! In this case I did find that the \"smoked\" aspect of the salmon was overpowering the other elements of the main. Would I order this dish again? Yes, but I would ask for fries as my side.\n\nAngela and I ordered this dish because we wanted to end our meal on a \"sweet note.\" That was a good one eh.  Here you have Fresh Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes with Berry Compote, Maple Syrup, And Whipped Cream for $10. Since we received all our mains at the same time, I expected this dish not to taste as good because it was sitting there while we attacked our mains. Once we finished our savoury dishes we put them aside and pulled this plate closer to us. I broke off a piece and put it in my mouth expecting it to taste cold and dry because I did not pour a gallon of syrup on them like I usually do with my pancakes. Wrong! Yes, they were no longer hot, but they still tasted fresh. We were specially a fan of the whipped cream. It was nice and thick, and the berry compote was not too heavy or overpowering as I expected it to be. You could hardly taste the maple syrup because of the tanginess and tartness of the berry compote. But this was not a deal breaker. We totally made the right decision to end our meal with these pancakes.
The lobster mac n cheese was awesome! Never been there before but love lobster and it did not disappoint. I will definitely be going back and telling my friends.
We loved it small shop with friendly service. We had the lobster roll, shrimp roll, and lobster mac n cheese. All absolutely delicious. Complete with chunks of lobster. You certainly won't have to pick at your food to find em  Definitely worth the price!
A proper lobster roll. Toasted bun, lots of lobster meat with a light coating of seasoned mayo. No other fillers etc. It was excellent and I'm not usually a fan of the traditional hot dog buns.\n\nThe menu was small but it had the key lobster dishes and as a bonus the coleslaw that came with the sandwich was crisp and very flavorful without being too sauced just like the sandwich.\n\nNice setting outside. I just wish they had other things I miss from home like steamers.
Name says it all as far as the menu goes - Lobstermans.   While they do have a few token other things, 95% is lobster based.  It is fresh, it is delicious, and they don't skimp on the portions.  While I have never been to Maine, it is exactly how I would picture a Maine lobster shack menu to be like.\n\nLocated right on the water in Lake Las Vegas, the atmosphere is gorgeous.   It is nothing fancy - more like a fast food type restaurant than anything, but the staff is very friendly, and the personal service was excellent.\n\nConsidering the main ingredient, prices are very reasonable.  Most items $10 to $20.  Lobster roll was $17, and so packed with lobster, I did not eat my bag of chips.
This place will never last. GREAT idea, but so poorly executed. If you want a hot dog bun with some lobster on top, here ya go. They have no idea how to make an edible meal. If you can screw up anything with lobster, that's pretty sad. No flavor and expensive. Pass on this one.
Are here a few weeks ago. Cute little spots. TONS of lobster in each dish. Will be back again!
Delicious!!! I ordered a lobster roll as well as the lobster flat bread and cannot say enough good things about these yummy delights! The lobster was fresh & amazing!! And I am very particular about items mixed with mayo but they don't pre-mix their lobster meat for the lobster rolls so they were able to put it on the side. The flat bread had artichokes and light cheese and was just amazing. Plus they were very very generous with the lobster portions!!  Will absolutely be going back next visit!
I tried this place because I had seen a add on Facebook . This place was not that great I'm better of going to panda bear express . Service was great but food was not . Will never go back
Restaurant is in a run down strip mall, but once you are inside it is nice.  Me and my date were seated very fast.  Silverware was never brought to my date.  I tried to ask the waitress, but she was so busy.  It looked like she was the server for the whole restaurant.  I just grabbed silverware from an empty table.  I ordered the BBQ spare rib appetizer.  The appetizer came after our meals.  I ordered the house lo main.  It was very greasy but not bad.  My date had the Sesame chicken, it was very good.  Also the fried chips or won tons they bring to the table are great.  The reason for the two star is ad we ask for the check, that is when we are told cash only.  She said there debit machine was down.  Thank god I had cash, I rarely keep cash.  That should of been told to us at the door.  I won't return unless I have cash.  It us not bad food, but I would not go when busy service is just not good enough.
Thank you Oriental House for a great lunch! I called an order for carry out. Hot and sour soup and egg drop soup was very good. Just enough heat for hot and sour and egg drop was very pleasant. Not bland and corn starchy. Vegetable fried rice was excellent. Pieces of pea pods, mushroom, zucchini , broccoli , onion, water chestnuts, not made with frozen vegetables . Singapore noodles were awesome! It had a tad too much fish sauce, but the curry and noodles were spot on! Pork, Shrimp, chicken delish. We will be ordering again soon!
Orange chicken was soggy & tasteless. \n\nChow mein was total waste. Horrible & nasty taste. \n\n$50+ dollar mistake that will never ever happen again.
So disappointed took 1 and 1/2 hours to get food beef\nLo mein was horrible pork fried rice looked like white rice with very little pork in and crab puffs were cold! I called after 1 hour and she said he will be in a few minutes  took them another 30 minutes only live 10 minutes from the store! I did get it for free but wish I had just ordered pizza!
The worst Chinese food we've ever had. I ended up not eating any of it. $50 down the drain. We ordered two appetizers (crispy squid and shu mi). For dinner crispy duck, hot and spicy beef and the curry chicken   All terrible. I'm so sorry to have to say this. We've eaten Chinese food in many countries and in many states. This one is sadly awful. We will never go back. My husband says it's a zero. Save your money and go elsewhere or stay home and have a sandwich. Wish we had.
I had to put one start because its an obligation, although we were greeted and seated quickly and our server was very friendly and attentive,i have to say the food was very disatisfaing, they have faulse advertising their menu shows picture that have nothing to do with the actual served food we ordered the yum tom soup which show large shrimp only to recieve 6 tiny rubbery shrimp, the shumai was the size of bite size snickers  and had no shrimp it was a paste of some sort with no flavor,and during out dinner there we dont know what happened but our order was not placed correctly even though we told our waiter our order and saw her write it down we were awkardly waiting for the rest of our food to arrive only to find out she never put in our full order to the chef to begin with, as we decided at that point to leave, i asked out waitress \"excuse me did you write down our order\" she said \" yes\" when i asked her to look at what we had ordered she said \"oh, im sorry. i didnt write it down did you still want it?\" That maid us feel so furious since we had been waiting for along time just to find out that it was never coming we feel ripped off and it was just so awkard to sit there and wait for food you initially ordered but was never placed! We left and will never ever return, and we dont recommend this place to anyone! 99th ave and peoria! Please dont go! Food is not worth it we feel like we paid $ 45 for nasty, cheap food! Facebbok followers please dont write faulse reviews im a chinesse food lover but this is one of the worst place ive ever been to!
2nd visit to this place since they opened. Had the same waitress, must say I am surprised she is still there. She needs training on how to speak with customers.  Management is not much better, no enthusiasm or appreciation for customers. Customary things like hello, how is everything, thank you for coming etc. D\u00e9cor is awful, had to step over a banner laying in the middle of the floor to get to the restroom.  Find somewhere else, like Good China or Chang Lee. Food is mediocre here.
As much as I don't like to have order from menu at Chinese restaurant, I just loved this place! Nice decor , very fancy place !\nFood was delishhhhh!!! Can't believe some Yelpers wrote negative review, they might did not know difference of bad places and bad food!!!\nI will be back !!!!
No so good food everything is too blend for me wish it was as good as somewhere  I eat before in Peoria but I guess I will take my business somewhere else and it was a Sunday and no one was there
overall experience at this restaurant was positive and they do many things well. They have taken over a building that was more of a homestyle restaurant so you can tell based upon the interior design. I would return and it seems decent for a Chinese restaurant in the West Valley.  it seems family owned and everyone was friendly. The Thai curry sauce was probably not a paste, more of a powder base so it wasn't as in-depth and flavorful but it was still OK. The fried rice did not have any vegetables in it so I probably would order regular white rice next time
I could eat here daily. Ordered take out and it came quick fresh and HOT!!! I had Hot and Sour soup AMAZING the salt and pepper Calamari small order wish I would have ordered a large, it was the best I have had in 20 years!!! I love the shredded pork but next time I will try something new. This will be a weekly dinner stop for sure
I ordered 40 dollars in food and got nothing. After two hours of waiting and multiple calls of not being able to find my house and lies about being given the wrong address i cancelled my order. I've never had such a hard time with delivery in my life. I can't say anything about the food itself and I never will as they have lost me as a customer the first time out. I highly recommend dining in because their drivers won't find you.
Fantastic food and service. We tried the egg rolls, orange chicken, shrimp lo mein, and shrimp egg foo young.
The decor is so cute! It is definitely a very clean place from the front of house to the bathroom. The food is standard for a little Chinese place. Nothing above or below average, enjoyable definitely. The server we had was new and very sweet. She didn't speak perfect English, so she tried very hard to make sure we understood what she was saying. She kept our waters full and gave us unlimited rice refills. All in all a good experience.
The food was awesome! The only complaint I have was how long it took us to get our food. I could see a whole counter full of take out getting bigger but our food took a good 30mins and came out 2 meals at a time (for a 9 person group that was weird).\nI saying that I do realize that it was Mother's Day and they were busy.
Terrible food.  When this restaurant first opened the food was good but now it is terrible.  Even after saying we would never be back we tried it again and not only had a bad experience but also got deathly ill from the food. \nWe ordered the ribs and asked for them not to be burnt.  The top two of the four ribs were the way we asked for them to be but the other two ribs were not only burnt but we're half the size of the top two.  We complained and was told by the waiter that if we wanted different ribs we would need to pay for another order.  This is crazy.  How can they get away with selling inferior food.  \nThe last time we ate there we ordered orange chicken.  It was so spicy we immediately told the waitress who then spoke to the owner.  The owner did nothing to make it right and made sure we paid for it even though we only had two pieces.  \nAll this restaurant seems to care about is making money.  They do not care a thing about customer service.  \nDo not waste your money.  It's worth driving further for better food.
My first order ever, was for delivery on a Sunday afternoon.  I didn't have a menu, so I just ordered personal favorites -  Hot and sour soup, spring rolls, and general Tso's chicken with white rice.\n\nThe delivery was super fast!  Everything I ordered arrived including the menu I had requested. The hot and sour soup is one of my all-time favorites, and believe me lots of Chinese restaurants don't do it very well. Oriental House has an excellent hot and sour soup - I highly recommend it. And even the crispy noodles came with the soup at no extra charge.  The spring rolls were fine but not my absolute favorite.\n\nGeneral Tso's chicken was nice and crispy with a slightly spicy sweet sauce that was quite tasty.  Even the white steamed rice tasted exceptionally good. The portions are quite large and I have enough leftover food for at least two more meals.\n\nThis is definitely the best Chinese food I have found in the Sun City area, since moving here four years ago. I will be a regular customer and recommend them to friends and neighbors. \n\nI'm looking forward to visiting the restaurant and trying out some of their lunch specials, which are priced quite nicely.
I liked it.  This was more the east coast influenced that I'm used to, so they get 5 stars in my book.  Friendly staff didn't mind all of my questions and they were very attentive.  Prices were good for the amount of food provided.  Will go back again because I want to try the Pad Thai.
A little more on the expensive side but I have zero complaints about the food. Everything was delicious and served in huge portions. I was also delighted to find out they deliver. While I haven't been there in person yet, I will be making orders from here in the future
While a little off the beaten path it was worth finding. Service was friendly and with a smile. Egg drop soup and crispy sesame chicken were tasty. I'll come back again.
Oriental House is great! As you walk in there is hand wash to cleanse your hands. I like this idea!! We were greeted and seated very quickly. It's a lovely place; very pretty. The wait staff is very friendly. Most of the lunch specials are in the $6 to $7 range; lots to choose from. I got the Sesame Chicken with Fried Rice. Yummy!
Food is disgusting. I told my daughter not to go to this restaurant because the food is not only terrible but if you have an issue the owners don't care enough to make it right.\nAnyways she decided to try it and got very sick from the food.\nMy family and friends will never be back. We need a better restaurant in this location.
The outside of the building is awesome looking. Might be an old Denny's but they redecorated nicely. The inside is very clean. The servers are nice and courteous. The hot and sour soup is some of the best I've ever had. I ordered the orange chicken extra spicy. It was the perfect amount of spice. Overall the best Chinese I've had in the west valley. Don't mind bad service reviews these guys just opened a week or so ago.
In 1 word, sucked. Ordered Mongolian beef.. that's safe, right? Every Chinese food place on the face of the Earth can do Mongolian Beef.... Nope. The beef tasted freezer burnt, and was not cooked done.. need was chewy.. like undercooked chewy.. ordered with fried rice.. double nope... Dunno what it was, I can only describe the taste as \"dusty\".. like they found a bag of rice in a dark corner that they had forgotten about and decided to use it.. told the server, she said sorry and charged the full amount. Explained that that had a new chef.. sorry... Yep, me too.. but I won't be sorry again...
It was pretty good, not the best I've had but we will be going back. We got the $18.99 family meal with the egg drop soup, and hot and sour soup, potstickers, orange chicken, and beef veggies. The meal fed myself, my husband, and my 3 and 7 year old. The portions are pretty good. The egg drop soup had an off putting smell to me, it's very eggy but my kids liked it. My husband seemed to enjoy his hot and sour soup, it looked like it had a good amount of tofu in it. The potstickers were really yummy, my favorite part of the meal. The beef and veggies was good too. I've seen others in the reviews say the orange chicken was really spicy... I did not notice anything spicy in it. It was also more sweet than I am used to for orange chicken. I wish it was a little more spicy though... they do have hot chili oil at the tables but i didn't see it until we were basically done. I also wish they gave a bit more rice with the dishes, but I guess I didn't really ask for more either. Overall it was a good meal and I'm happy to see a decent chinese restaurant come to the West Valley area. We will go back and perhaps try some of their other dishes.
Great food.  Last time we visited it seemed that the waitress was new.  She was sweet and managed to get through serving our small group.   Today the waitress seemed a little lost and there seemed to be a bit of a language barrier but again it all worked out and the meals were delicious.
Went for lunch special and was very impressed. Server was very pleasant and courteous. Food was very good, large portions, and served very quickly.  Decor is fun! Full bar. Very clean.
This is a great addition to the neighborhood. We were seated quickly. The food was great and we have excellent service.  We will be back again, there is a lot to try on the menu. \n\nWe had Won Ton Soup, Lo mein and orange chicken were all better be than expected.  Will be back. 5 stars for food and service.
Oriental House has the best Chinese food with a 5 mile radius.  Egg rolls are large, not heavy with oil.  Kung Pao Chicken was the best I've had in my life, & I've been around.  Egg drop soup is not salty like most Chinese restaurants.  Good size portions & they offer a 10% Senior Discount just for the asking.  Alex, our waiter, is very pleasant, has a good sense of humor, & he'll make sure you are satisfied with the taste of the food.  I do not recommend the Sweet & Sour Pork.  We are not that hot about eating deep fried foods, but, we thought we'd try this one.  Pork was dried & chewy probably from it being cooked twice.  Sent it back without a problem.  Maybe they'll change the way it's prepared. Who knows. The owners have a successful restaurant in Yuma, \"Yuma Palace\", so, they are not beginners like the last two previous tenants in this building.  I hope they can sustain for longer than 2 years by winning over patrons from some of the other nearby Asian food restaurants.  they're cleaned up the inside &  outside.  I wish them much luck & happiness in their new venture.  give them a try!!  (No, I'm not related to them.  I'm Euro-American.)
I don't mind paying for food, as long as it's worth it in quantity and taste; i was very disappointed. It is not worth it. I ordered duck and there was very little meat to it with white rice. They gave me a little sauce, which didn't taste good. I regret ordering there.
great chicken lo mein, I wasn't a fan of the fried wonton.
Delivery is FAST. Food is fresh and delicious. Their fried food is not greasy. I love their sauces. I get the chicken curry and the chicken satay a lot for lunch. They have a wide variety of choices and they are very accommodating with modifications. I highly recommend them! And you can order online or through an app, sooooo convenient :)
I'm no Chinese food expert but my tongue knows what it likes. And it likes this place. Live in the area so decided to give it a shot and order take out. Orange chicken was crispy and tasty. Egg drop soup was rich and savory. Staff was very friendly. Also great lunch time special prices. Lots of tasty and filling  food for a low price; I'm looking forward to trying more of the menu!\n\nEdit: Kung pao chicken wasn't very good. Had no kick and sauce was thin
Six of us came here for Christmas day lunch and had a wonderful time. The waitress was friendly and helpful, the restaurant was nicely decorated and the food was much better than I would have expected in a West Valley Chinese restaurant, where I suspect most customers prefer their Chinese food to be bland and sweet. \n\nThe hot and sour soup was excellent - filled with lots of fresh vegetables. My husband said the Kung Pao Chicken was good (not great) but I got a Thai Curry that actually had some heat to it - nicely prepared and I practically licked the platter clean. Our friends all said they enjoyed their meals very much and we all said we planned to visit this restaurant again. \n\nI have to wonder about the customer who said the food was disgusting. Every plate I saw coming from the kitchen looked inviting, and the other customers seemed to be enjoying their food as much as we were.
My husband and I dined in on a Sunday, late afternoon.  There were a number of people there, always a good sign.  The staff was very pleasant and eager to please.  Despite English not being their first language, communication was not a problem.  We  both enjoyed our meals - lemon chicken and teriyaki beef and shrimp, which were hot and delicious - and very plentiful!  The restaurant was clean and roomy.  We are so glad to have a good Chinese food restaurant of this caliber in the neighborhood!
The food is great and there's lots of it but the services sucks,tonight are server spoke little or No English so it was real hard getting things that we needed my granddaughter ordered a Sprint for her drink and a Pepsi came out boy can we say wrong thing . Has No idea how to serve food to a person kept reaching across in front of a person They All need to learn how to sever a person the right way hate to say I my not be back for a New place you may went to real think your choice Sorry
Really good food! The orange chicken is really really spicy but flavorful. Beef and broccoli and sesame chicken are awesome. The only thing is that the dinners only come with rice, but the portions are very generous. Love this place.
I had our meal delivered.  They deliver within 5 miles of their restaurant, for only $2.  I ordered sesame chicken, which was delicious.  The sauce was a sweet, thicker, brown sauce.  The steamed white rice my kids loved. Also ordered the veggie fried rice, and that too was yummy with a buttery flavor.  The veggie lo mein was very tasty, the noodles were thick but light and soft in texture plus they had a. Yummy buttery flavor.  Finally we ordered veggie egg foo yung, it was fantastic, but the sauce served with it was unbelievably amazing!  Overall this was an excellent delivery meal.
We ordered the sesame chicken, general tso's chicken & egg drop soup. It was all very \"meh\". We did get it to go & by the time we got it home the food was incredibly soggy. The soup was pretty good though. If we try it again we will try dining in. Heads up, I'm pretty sure they use MSG.
Read about this new Asian restaurant and had to give it a try. Server was quick and friendly, making sure we were comfortable and if we had any questions. Our two orders (chow mein and vegetables w/pork with several special requests came prepared as requested and delicious. Everything tasted like it was entirely freshly prepared. Spring rolls were the best we've ever had. We'll be back real soon to Oriental House. Sincerely, Karen & Art Huseonica, Sun City, AZ
Last Chinese place(Wong jr) I ordered from was meh, saw this place delivered so I gave it a shot. Use online service and ordered Mongolian beef w/ rice, crab puffs, and it required a $15 minimum so I added a drink. Total being around $20 plus tip. Placed the online order around 12:36pm, food arrived at 1:48pm--an hour wait. Idk if them putting my drink inside the same bag with my food was the reason or what, but doesn't matter. \n\nThe foods not worth it, especially with the quality of food--The crab ragoon$4.55 were more wonton than anything, and the Mongolian beef$9.95 had an excess of oil around it with chucky cut onions, and tastes okay \"meh\", Panda Express has more flavor and costs less. \n\nOverall my experience in a nut shell...Long wait, and foods not worth time or money.
My first visit here last week was very very good. The girl that waited on us was so pleasant and helpful and took great care of us. I came back again today with another friend and the guy that waited on us could not understand our orders. He was really struggling. We did not get our drinks and had to ask twice. later for refills . He went to go and take our cups and we reach quickly and grabbed our straws and he forgot to bring back the refills. We had to ask twice for our soup , Then later I got one egg roll, and then I got my meal and my friend was brought something she didn't order. it was a wait to get her food. The food was good,  but care is needed in choosing your wait staff. Comparing the first visit to the second visit was night and day. I was excited to have this restaurant so close to our home, but I'm not sure I will return again soon.
I ordered delivery. After an hour a very hot and sweaty young man was at my door. He had the wrong address and phone number on the delivery slip! When I ordered the man barely spoke English and I had to remind him that info three times! Yet he still got it wrong!!! Plus I order House fried rice and they sent me pork. The food was average. Nothing but gooy wontons in the soup and same with Hot and Sour soup. There is a place on Olive and 91st ave that is the best ever! Tons of everything in all their items and taste incredible. I'll stick with them in the future! Pretty sure this review will be deleted by Oriental House.
Stopped in at Moreno's Mexican on Sunday to pick up some appetizers for our crew. After talking to the manager, Jesus, and hearing the backstory of how Moreno's came to be known for their Sonoran Style hot dogs after humble beginnings as a foodie stop at the local tire shop, I just had to try them. Absolutely delicious! I don't know how they do it but it is bursts of flavor on a Mexican bun. A true Mexican bun, as well. They are imported from Nogales. I was a big fan of their mild (chunky) salsa, bean dip, and queso. The hot was a little too hot for me but my company enjoyed it. The queso had a little kick to it, as well, but just the right amount and it seems tempered by the spinach that is mixed in - plus, you just might fool yourself into thinking it's a tad healthy. Just kidding! \n\nI will definitely be stopping by again. There is a surprisingly full menu. I heard rave reviews about the Chicken Fajita Burro and the Pollo Fundido. The service was quick, the atmosphere was friendly, they have happy hour specials with Margarita specials between 3-6 pm. There is outdoor seating or you can watch the games on the tv inside. Catering is available, as well.
Good stuff.  One of my standard go to places. Like their green salsa and beans.  Great crispy shredded beef tacos and cheese enchiladas.  Prefer this location to their Gecko Grill location in Gilbert or Morenos in downtown Chandler.
This place is really clean, including the bathrooms which isn't common at Mexican restaurants. I like that you can pick where you want to sit. Its a little small but the service is fast and friendly. The food is the best! I love Mexican food and I'm always trying new places and this is by far the best. The prices are a little more than I'm used to but I'm okay paying that because the food is fresh and hot and the place is clean, service is great, and the bean dip is so good. I will be back!
Been going there for a while however stopped going because they charged me for salsa when I had a to go order. Mexican food places are a dime a dozen and I refuse to pay for salsa, this was a first time for me getting billed for salsa. Lol
For a strip mall faster type food it's pretty good have had breakfast and dinner here and will have today I have no complaints. The staff are humping  they help each other out on tables. They do have beer here. Small area outside seating.
The food was good but the atmosphere & service was HORRIBLE!!! The orders were wrong, we had to ask twice for chips & asked 3 times for boxes.
Best kept secret for breakfast!!!  SHHH don't tell.  Everyone else can wait in line at the chain breakfast resturants.
Worst Mexican food!  Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about.  This is the furthest from authentic Mexican as you can get.  Everything is dry as a bone no matter how much sauce you put on it. The tortilla soup was seriously canned chicken broth, dry shredded chicken and a ton of diced avocado I guess that made it look authentic.  The staff are friendly high schoolers but have zero sense of urgency. My food and my kids food came first and we waited 10 minutes for my husbands food.  Found the server standing behind the counter joking and laughing with his friends as our food sat under the heat lamp.   The nachos with Chicken were so dry my kids would not eat them and they pretty much eat anything!  We sent them back only to be charged $2 dollars for a side of sour cream!  Are you kidding??!!The tamales were over cooked and dried out.  I mean seriously this place has such amazing potential - get the food and the service in order and it's a keeper.
I'm very particular when it comes to Mexican Food and this has been excellent every single time I've been there.  The location is tiny but always busy and they do quite a bit of to go orders as well!  Very good food for an excellent price.  Food always comes out quickly and hot!  \n\nThere always seem to be quite a few servers however they seem to not really have rhyme or reason to where they should be so you just wait for your person to come back.  Bus boys are always cleaning and turning over tables quickly!\n\nGreat food and lunch specials!  Happy hour menu too!
Small establishment in a strip mall,  but the service was good,  the food was excellent,  and the price was decent as well.   Next time I'm in AZ and craving Mexican,  I'll more than likely make this stop.
Food is OK but its not a comfortable environment when the owner hovers over the cash register and watches everyone in the dinning room.. He makes it uncomfortable when your trying to enjoy your food and company then look up and the owner is staring.. Staff other than that is good.. I just don't think the owner needs to be at the front watching everyone. There's not even enough room for him to be up there. My mom won't even go there anymore because of that reason.
This place rocks.  Our newest favorite Mexican food!  The staff is all wonderful and always say hello and good by!  The soup is great and comes in a huge portion.  I love the sea food chimis. My hubby always has the combo #1.  They also rock for breakfast!
Food is good. Service is the worst service I have encountered in a really long time...I'm a server, so it takes a lot for me to say this. Service sucked AND Has ALWAYS sucked. My son loves this place so, I come here often and share fajitas with him and my boyfriend. It takes me everything I have not to get up and start serving myself lol.
Pretty good food! Horrible service and the cleaning supplies they use are absolutely horrible. They should reconsider that.\n\nThe Shrimp Quesidilla, Mixed Burrito and the Sonoran Hot Dogs. All bomb!!
I have eight in Mexican restaurants all over the valley California New Mexico Nevada friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food deafly makes it a six star restaurant I would recommend it to anybody at any time it is fantastic
We just ate lunch here.  Chips and Salsa were great.  I ordered the Pollo Fundido.  Other Mexican restaurants I've order this at have drenched the jalapeno cream cheese over the dish, but not here.  =(  I was disappointed when I asked for sour cream, because after the first bite, I didn't even think there was the \"cream sauce\" on the dish.  After the fourth bite, I got to some of the cream sauce, and it was maybe 1 tsp slabbed on the top.  I then asked for more cream sauce, which I told was going to be a dollar charge.  (It was actually a little over a dollar, and then I was also charged for the sour cream)\n\nOur waitress was a sweet, but as a server, I would have NEVER charged extra for a sauce that was already on the dish, and probably not for the sour cream.  \n\nI was disappointed with the service and the lack of fundido sauce.  I wouldn't return to this location.... stinks since it's so close to my work. I wasn't expecting a $15 lunch today. \n\n=(
Eat here 3-4 times a month.  Service is always good, staff friendly and the food consistently good.  Coupons via text and in print ads - a discount just adds to the goodness.
DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU THINK THIS IS THE SAME AS THE MORENOS IN MESA.\n\nI was in the area and about to stop at the Chipotle down the street, but I flipped a u-turn once I saw the sign for Morenos. $3.89 for a regular soft carne asada taco?! Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the same company as the Morenos in Mesa on Broadway road?? Their tacos are less than $2 each and oh so delicious... I haven't even eaten my food and am already upset. 3 tacos for $11.67+tax... That would've gotten me a burrito bowl at Chipotle along with a drink and maybe chips. I guess they overcharge for \"authentic\" carne asada tacos when selling them in a mostly new and white neighborhood. \n\nI'm normally not one to rant or even give reviews, but as someone who's tried authentic tacos all over the valley, that didn't rub me the right way. There's not even a salsa bar!!! The green salsa had no hint of spice, it almost tasted sweet. To add to the disappointment, these are not authentic carne asada tacos. They come with shredded cheese, guacamole, and pico. Real street tacos usually just come with cilantro and onions. \n\nNeedless to say, it's a good thing I live not too far from the Mesa location, because I will never be back and don't recommend it. Too overpriced and not tasty.
Poor service and over priced for average food. More of a Taco Bell style of Mexican food. Staff is obviously young and does not have a clue as how business actually works.\n\nI went, I ate and I will never go back!
Tasty food, quick service, affordable.  I had the Santa Fe Burrito which was very tasty.  Nothing overpowered any other flavor so it was perfect blending.  The burritos are large and could easily be two meals.\n\nThe red salsa is pretty good but I loved their green salsa so much more.  Sweet with a kick.  I would definitely eat there again!
Went to Moreno's with my husband tonight for dinner. We chose Moreno's since we had a buy one get one coupon. I was pleasantly surprised at how great it was. We were there during their happy hour so our meal started off with discounted margaritas and the complimentary chips, two types of salsa, and beans. Gotta say that was a plus right away. Staff was super friendly. I ordered the street tacos. They were really yummy. The tacos were filled with lean shredded beef. My husband got the crab chile relleno and said it was really good. Overall it was a great experience. We went for the coupon tonight, but we will definitely go back for the food.
I went to this place because everyone was recommending their Sonoran hot dogs. This was not my favorite but I ordered their mango quesadillas and they were amazing.  The chips and their bean dip is also great. Will be coming back to try other things
Good atmosphere and service. The food is good but not great. We always enjoy coming after church on Sundays.
Came here for dinner. The whisky selection is robust which is probably expected since the restaurant sits below the Whisky experience. The staff though seemingly on the young side were great with suggestions for the whisky and I now like bowmore! The food was quite tasty kind of like tapas style and varied. A little bit of everything.
We had the pleasure of dining at the amber before the tattoo. We booked the Amber package which included a 3 course per show dinner before the tattoo. For the starter, there was a smoked salmon pinwheel, beef carpaccio, haggis Bon Bon and goat cheese Wellington. All very good. In fact, I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed the haggis Bon Bon. The main was beef filet with mushroom sauce, purple carrots and potato cake. I was not as impressed with the main. The beef and potatoes seemed to be dried out by a heat lamp. The dessert was a whisky chocolate pot and cream cake served with a dram of 12 years old Deanston whisky. The whisky pot was delectable while the cream cake was unmemorable. Dinner was finished with local goat cheese on oat cake, coffee and Scottish fudge. Overall the meal was good. I am sure it could have been sensational if it were not served banquet style.
We ordered 4 main courses and 1 starter. All of them are good especially the steak & haggis.
Unfortunately , we were very underwhelmed. The fish was bland and risotto undercooked. Best things of the evening were the baked goat cheese and drinks.
Horrible service, tasteless food. We loved the tour, but we REALLY wish we didn't do this restaurant for the food. It killed a lot of time and the food was absolutely forgettable.
Excellent bar. All of the bartenders are very knowledgeable. Stuart was amazing. He had lots of good recommendations for different single malts. Had a very good whiskey selection. Over 300 single malts on display. We had already been to a couple of distilleries so skipped the scotch experience tour, happy we did that. Highly recommend sitting at the bar and learn about Scottish whiskey and have a few drinks.
If you're a whiskey fan, this is your heaven. Period.\n\nI didn't expect much from the place downstairs from the sort-of-gimmicky Scotch Whisky Experience, but Amber really delivers. Their scotch selection is nothing short of world-class, and their menu helps non-experts find true gems. I grinned like an idiot for the entire two hours I spent there. They recommended the Edradour Ibisco from a tiny distillery in Pitlochry, and it changed my life.\n\nJust go. It's about as good as it gets on the Royal Mile.
Fun restaurant, good food, great staff. Very nice. My kids loved it. They had a great sea bass dish for kids. Pricing was very reasonable for the quality of the food.\n\nHighly recommend the whiskey tour. Starts out a bit cheesy with a ride through the distillation process, but it gets better. Better description of the different whiskies than I have relieved before.  The whiskey collection was the best part of the tour. The gold tour comes with a good tasting at the end. \n\nIf your interested in scotch, it's a great place to start
Really cool place especially right after a tour.  You can sample a whiskey region you just learned about.  A little expensive, but good ambiance and the food was good.
Had lunch here with the ladies.   We each had a whiskey and a meal.  I don't remember the meal at all but the whiskey was smoky and a number 16.
I booked a table for us at Amber Restaurant, thinking it would be a good place to eat after visiting the Scotch Whisky Experience. \n\nWe showed up 30 minutes early to our reservation and the wait staff was very nice and let us wait in the bar before it was even open. The bartender recommended whiskey and lemonade for me, and it was a delicious combination. Our waiter was also very nice and attentive. \n\nThe restaurant had the best bread ever! It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I had the smoked salmon appetizer with the chicken stuffed with sage and brioche main course. Both were really good and very generous helpings.
Amber Restaurant is bang in front of Edinburgh Castle at the very top of the Royal Mile, but its so well hidden that even some of the locals don't know its there! That doesn't mean its not very busy on any given day however. It draws in a certain amount of custom from visitors to the Scotch Whisky Experience and can be accessed via their reception area or a door at the rear of the attached Whisky Shop, then down the stairs. Its worth seeking out! \n\nAmber has something of a cafe vibe and you can head in there for just a scone and coffee or something more substantial, like a full lunch with a glass of wine, or maybe something from their very reasonably prices whisky list! They offer advice on matching whisky with food. Nice idea! There is also a whisky tasting lounge alongside and plenty of experts on hand to dispense knowledge.\n\nI had a scrumptious lunch of vegetarian haggis with neeps and tatties nicely finished off with a whisky cream sauce - there's a bit of a whisky theme going on but its not in everything! Apparently the smoked haddock was a bit special too, but lacked my lovely sauce. Cheese and crackers seemed like a good idea to end the meal, so I ordered the clava brie with oatcakes and plum chutney. It was quite pungent for a brie but the chutney helped balance the strong flavours. We left full and happy. Would recommend Amber if you are in that part of town.
Best meal I've had so far in Scotland.  \n\nWas not expecting much since it was tied to the Whiskey Experience, but would go out of my way just to eat here again.
Amber is quite literally a hidden gem in what is otherwise one of the busiest parts of Edinburgh, at the top of the Royal Mile and tucked away at the back of the Whisky Heritage Centre. You enter the Heritage Centre and descend the stairs at the rear to find Amber. It's more 'laid-back bistro' than posh restaurant, yet it is smart and has a relaxing ambience; a perfect combination if you enjoy good food, but not a formal atmosphere.\n\n\n Alongside the eating area is a cosy wee bar where they have a massive selection of whiskies for you to sample and, should you wish, be educated about. The bar is well stocked with non-whisky tipples too!\n\n\n Some of the food at Amber (unsurprisingly) has a whisky theme, though the whisky never overpowers the food where it has been used. Haggis and Vegetarian Haggis comes with a whisky cream sauce which is divine. The meals are very well prepared and attractively presented. Desserts are also very impressive and the wine list has been very well put together and isn't overpriced. It's possible to eat very well and very cheaply at lunchtime. A real treat! Highly recommended by locals!
A very good place, best huggies ever :)\nThe whiskey bar is amazing as well - definitely see the whisky experience with its collection of 3k items shown -amazing\n\na bit crowded though, thats why the 4 stars.
The steak and potatoes was wonderful!  Best meal we've had since arriving in Great Britain 2 weeks ago.
354 Castlehill\nThe Royal Mile\nEdinburgh EH1 2NE\ntel : 0131 477 8477\nfax: 0131 220 6288\nhttp://www.amber-restaurant.co.uk\nReasonably priced Scottish cuisine at it's best. Friendly and helpful staff in a very comfortable environment. Has a great whiskey bar with tasting and knowledgeable staff. Also has a cosy caf\u00e9 with light food and yummy cakes.
Amber, situated at the top of castlehill, beyond the witchery within the scotch whisky heritage centre. The nice ambient atmosphere with a great scottish menu, boasting the best of local produce. The restaurant is small yet ample in size to not feel crowded, as they only put tables for the number of diners booked each evening. \nIn addition to the food, they have a fantastic array of whisky to tempt the tastebuds on a cold winter night and an expert on hand to guide you without making you feel daft for not knowing your regions. A first class place to dine.
This place was awesome. Simple foods, nice wines, and beautifully decorated.
Great food on both the lunchtime snackish menu & the more desciptive evening menu, also an extensive wine list. Got seated straight away although you can always take a seat in the bar while you wait. The staff are also very attentive & the service is quick.
My husband and I completely lucked into discovering Amber; we spent more time than we'd planned to at Edinburgh Castle, and were starving when we left.  We immediately walked by Amber, thought the menu sounded interesting, and went in for a late lunch.\n\nYou wouldn't expect a restaurant in the Scotch Whisky Experience to be impressive, but this certainly is.  The room itself is beautiful and has a nice view out the windows.  Service is friendly and helpful.  My husband  had the lamb stovies and loved it.  I ordered the herb crusted coley, and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  The mussels and leeks were done perfectly, the dumplings were outstanding, and the sauce was to die for.\n\nWe liked the restaurant so much we came back the next day for the Platinum Tour (another future review) and the Taste of Scotland.  Again, this showed how amazing Scottish food really is-- who knew?  The tapas included a scallop, smoked salmon, and black pudding (two for three here, but that's a matter of personal taste) and for entrees we got duck, lamb, and the coley.  The duck was delicious and not at all greasy.  The lamb was so tender you could cut it with a fork, and came with surprisingly good haggis potatoes.  For dessert we had a toffee cake paired with a whisky, and it was absolutely amazing.  The servers can give helpful reccomendations about whisky (as well as other drinks), and there's even a whisky sommelier should you need truly expert advice.\n\nPrices are really fairly reasonable, and the Platinum Tour/Taste of Scotland is really a steal considering how much comes with the tour.  Definitely somewhere you should go if you find yourself in Edinburgh.
When my wife booked this for my birthday, I brought out my \"jump to conclusions\" mat and figured this would be another expensive dinner in Edinburgh, 1) thanks to being in Edinburgh and 2) my belief that the Whisky Experience and Amber Restaurant were tourist traps.  However, I was pleasantly surprised and packed away my \"jump to conclusions\" mat for another time.\n\nDrinks. The bartender couldn't have been a shade over 25, yet he had knowledge of whiskies beyond his years (and mine too).  I was interested in putting together a whisky sampler and sought his advice.  I told him the basics of what I was looking for and after a few more questions, he came back with four glasses of whisky (with the bottles), a glass of water, and a very detailed explanation as to the different whiskies, their regions, and what to look for.  It was a great addendum to the Whisky Experience tour.\n\nFood. The food was excellent and was exactly what we were looking for to top off the Whisky Experience tour.  The Scottish tapas and fresh bread were a great start to the meal and were quickly followed up by our main course.  I went with the lamb pot with a side of roasted carrots; my wife had the same roasted pot with a side salad.  My two boys had bacon sandwiches, and after their food came, I wondered if I made a mistake and didn't get what they had! To top it off, the prices were very reasonable and nothing what I expected.  To break it down, here was our bill:\n\n-2 kid bacon sandwiches\n-order of bread and butter\n-Scottish Tapas\n-2 lamb pots\n-side salad\n-side of roasted carrots\n-gin and tonic\n-5 whiskies (1 x Drambuie 15 yr and 4 x hand selected whisky tasting selections)\n-carafe of water\n\nOur bill came to 64 pounds!  Now, after dropping 78 pounds at the Hard Rock Cafe and getting far less for my money, I was pleasantly surprised and was more than willing to spend the savings at the gift shop upstairs.  I'm pretty sure 6 x drinks at some other whisky bars in Edinburgh would probably set me back close to 60 pounds. \n\nFinally, the service was above reproach.  Very pleasant, very attentive, and very willing to say \"I don't know, let me get the expert\".  When I asked about the whisky sampler, our waitress went and brought the bartender over to help me out.  To me, that's a true sign of a knowledgeably, attentive, yet humble staff.  Highly highly highly recommend anyone who comes to Edinburgh, take one of your dinners here at the Amber Restaurant.
We had reservations for the \"Taste of Scotland\" dinner, which we tacked on to the end of the Whisky Experience Platinum Tour. They bundled everything - the tour and dinner - together into one ticket, which was nice.\n\nAfter the experience tour was done, our guide escorted us down to the restaurant, where we had a bit of a wait while they had our table set to rights. The restaurant was pretty busy that night, which meant that it was kind of loud, especially right by the entrance, but they put us at a table kind of near the back, where it was quieter.\n\nThe tasting dinner consisted of a three course meal, with another sample of whisky at the end (in addition to the three samples we'd gotten on the tour). \n\nThe first course was a starter, which contained a small pot of haggis, neeps and tatties, cheese on toast and some chicken liver pate. This was our first time sampling haggis (it was on our list, of course, but we hadn't had an opportunity prior to this), and though there may have been a bit of trepidation to start, we were game to try.\n\nI think the stigma of haggis keeps most people away. That, and the way it's most often described. But, it was actually very good. It has a bit of a mealy, grainy texture, but it was meaty and filling. Definitely not something I'd want to eat every day, as it was also a bit fatty, but I quickly realized there was never anything to be scared of. \n\nThe cheese and toast were very good - the cheese was herby, and it complimented the toast well. The pate was my least favorite on the dish - it had a very strong gizzard-like flavor that threw me.\n\nThe main course also consisted of three pieces: Scottish salmon over risotto, roasted lamb over tatties, and haggis-stuffed chicken over a sweet potato puree. Everything was tasty, but I think my favorite dish was the salmon over the risotto. The salmon was perfectly cooked, and surprised me by pairing well with the creamy risotto. The lamb was perfectly cooked. The haggis stuffing within the chicken breast made it fall apart when cutting into it, but that wasn't too much of an issue.\n\nThe dessert course was a chocolate hazelnut cake, which was paired with a Speyside whisky. Though the cake looked dense when it first got to us, it was actually very light - both in texture and in flavor. I love hazelnuts, so it was a perfect pairing for me, though it wasn't quite as nutty as I would have liked.\n\nThe service that night was decent - most of the staff was tied up with the large party I mentioned at the top of this review, so it took a bit of time for them to make their way to us. Everyone was friendly, at least, so that counts a lot.
Kleines, aber feines Restaurant in den Gem?uern der Scotch Whisky Experience (SWE) mit ambitionierter K\u00fcche\n\nIch war hier im Rahmen der \"Taste of Scotland\" - Tour der SWE als Abschlu? der Tour.\n\nIch wurde nach Betreten des Restaurants sofort freundlich begr\u00fc?t, platziert und nach eventuellen Allergien gefragt. Ausserdem wurde mir die Getr?nkekarte gereicht. Men\u00fcwahl war nicht m?glich, da das Men\u00fc ja Bestandteil der Tour war und somit festgelegt.\n\nDa ich im Rahmen der Tour schon 3 Whiskies getrunken habe (und ein 4. Whisky noch Men\u00fcbestandteil war) habe ich aus der reichhaltigen Getr?nkeliste ein.... Leitungswasser bestellt ;)\n\nDas Men\u00fc bestand mehr oder weniger aus einer Auswahl an typischen schottischen Gerichten, neu interpretiert, fein abgeschmeckt und ?u?erst schmackhaft. Was es alles war, kann ich gar nicht sagen, mein g?lisch ist nicht besonders ausgereift. ;)\n\nDer Service war sehr freundlich und immer in der N?he, ohne dabei aufdringlich zu wirken. Au?erdem wurde immer wieder nachgefragt, ob alles in Ordnung ist. Auch der Restaurantleiter hat sich nach dem Wohlergehen erkundigt.\n\nFazit: Wenn ich mal wieder in Edinburgh bin komme ich bestimmt auch ohne vorherige Tour mal wieder hier vorbei. Da kann ich dann die gesamte Leistung der K\u00fcche beurteilen.
After spending the morning and early afternoon at Edinburgh Castle, we were ready to find someplace to eat. Saw the menu at the Whiskey Experience and decided to try the Amber Restaurant. Downstairs (but there is an elevator) to a pub/restaurant. Nice servers, well presented meal. Not necessarily a huge menu choice, but enough for everybody's taste. Food arrived pretty quickly (nicely presented) and was tasty. \nMust say however, for all restaurants in Scotland, getting more than one glass of cold water becomes a trial.
Lovely food and unbelievable choice of whisky.
If you can make haggis tasty, you can damn well do just about anything! \n\nLocated right beneath the Edinburgh Castle ramparts, right off of the esplanade, is Amber Restaurant and Whiskey Bar. A lot of people obviously come for the whiskey tasting and the \"Scotch Whiskey Experience\". Yes, they have 400 whiskeys and they do an exceptional job of matching whiskey with their epic cheese selection, but don't get so drunk you can't enjoy eating off their menu!  \n\nOur starter was Four Scottish Cheeses from Iain Mellis (Edinburgh farmhouse and artisan cheesemonger) served with Amber Chutney. For the main course I had haggis with neeps and tatties in a whiskey sauce. Both were superb. \n\nI'm dropping a star merely on philosophy: They constantly change their menu.  I know you have to change things up, but I believe consistency helps. It sucks to come back and not have those wonderful things I had before.
Great location right by the Edinburgh Castle. Mussels were excellent as was the smoked salmon sandwich. Service was very pleasant and helpful. Tried a soft drink known as  Scotland's other National drink, called Irn Bru ( a less sweet cream soda) carrot cake for dessert, although very dry on outside, I suspect first piece of the day so left uncovered overnight? Was still very tasty.
Very chill spot off the royal, reasonably priced for the area. Food was delish, would definitely recommend the Haggis Neeps and Tattys for those trying Haggis for the first time. Had a wee glass of Auchentoshan 3 Wood to cap it off!
I enjoyed a great tasting dinner at Amber. Service was prompt and courteous and the ambiance of the restaurant was great. Location was adjacent to the castle and directly on the Royal Mile. The food was delicious and even though it was a tasting menu, there was plenty of it and I did not leave hungry. Everything prepared was fresh and beautifully presented. The whiskey, which was Aberfeldy 12 year was wonderful. There was time after the meal to shop in the gift store before walking to the Tattoo. It was a great way to kick off my Scotland adventure!
We didn't do the Whiskey Experience because we heard it wasn't great and there was no way we were going to wait on the line, so we figured that going to the bar downstairs would be the next best thing. \n\nThe bartender was very young but extremely knowledgable. He could tell you something about every bottle on the rack! He was also very nice and friendly, to boot. \n\nWe moved to the restaurant after our drinks where I had the speck in a creamy sauce with potatoes and leeks. It. Was. Delicious. And for the price, it couldn't be beat. \n\nI'd definitely recommend going to Amber as an alternative to the WE, but also as an affordable lunch near the castle.
This place is awesome!! I always get the Bistro Burger.... try it you will luv it. It's in the Art District 3b area, lots of art galleries and things to see as well.
I love the arts district downtown, and this place definitely has that same feel. The food was good and we went during happy hour so the deals were really great. Would definitely go again if I'm on that side of town.
Awesome spot. Nice staff and great food. Nice to walk around the art galleries after a few good cocktails from the nice bartenders. Salad was all chopped evenly and dressing was great. Steak tacos were some of my favorite in Vegas.
Let me just warn you all that the directions on iPhone send you to the wrong spot.  Don't rely on google maps, but head toward Artifice, because Mingo is slightly hidden and tucked away next to it.  Very inviting place once I found it.  We headed here before the Yelp block party on Fremont street, since the instructions said don't come hungry, and I was definitely hungry.\n\nThe bar opens up in the front of Mingo's so you have this open air effect, a la Park on Fremont.  Very cool.  I do think Mingo might be suffering a little bit of an identity crisis because the front is this really casual bar and inside it is full on club.  I kind of liked the contrast though.  Great happy hour menu with cheap drinks and eats.  Although big bites were offered, we stuck to the happy hour menu.  We had:\n\nfrench fries with siracha ketchup - amaze balls.  Really good.\nThe Kanye -  Yes, please.   A chicago style hot dog with incredibly spicy peppers.  Although the weiner was a little greasy (hehe), I loved the flavors.\nSliders - Average sliders, but well-cooked\n\nOverall, the food was much better than I expected.  Don't compare this place to Mundo's (Mingo's other establishment) because it is not trying to compete with Mundo.  This is an awesome addition to the arts district and it provides an alternative to Bar+Bistro if you are looking for some good grub.  I've had some not so great experiences at Bar+Bistro, and won't be going back, but service at Mingo was awesome and I would definitely hit this place up again.
This place was awesome I had the Cuban and the bacon wrapped stuffed dates which were super tasty. I've never written a yelp review and this place gave me the urge to write one if that says anything. Kinda reminds me of downtown la surrounded by art galleries and the hipster type feel. This place is definitely a hidden gem in Vegas.
Went here yesterday for the 1st time with friends and definitely like the vibe and look of the place. Small space but it's been utilized very well. Decor is on point. Happy hour is pretty good there as well. Staff was really nice and was on point most of the time. We had 6 in our party and a table big enough in back was set up for us ** bonus points for having at least one table inside that can accommodate that many people. Waitress was nice but seemed overwhelmed a bit and had to flag her down several times but it was packed by this time so it's understandable. Edamame was tasty, wings were crispy and good sauce on side was nice. The fried rice was delish. Ordered the fish as well and it was pretty good. I like crisper fish myself. For the happy hour price, I'd go all the time. Location is also great has its own parking lot so bonus and is super close to downtown with a trendy bar right next door. So far so good. I recommend checking it out.
I would give 4.5 stars if possible.  Misses the 5-star mark because the ketchup is laced with sirachi  hot sauce but our server failed to mention this....we learned the hard way when the toddler in our group began spitting out his food!  \n\nIf anywhere in the downtown vicinity and looking for dinner, I highly recommend Mingo.  They have patio seating outside in the Art Square courtyard that is perfect for Spring evenings.  This is a tapas style restaurant with a very nice craft beer selection and an excellent Happy Hour.  From 5-7pm, the Happy Hour worked for us on a Saturday.  In the $5 to $7 range, my party of 3 shared everything.  \n\nWe had edamame, roasted brussel sprouts, fried rice, the Kanye bacon-wrapped hotdog, Mahi Mahi tacos, and fish and chips.  The flavors of each dish were well planned and well executed.  The brussel sprouts were my favorite - roasted with candied almonds and raisins.  The Mahi Mahi tacos and Kanye hotdog were classic items decorated with the perfect toppings to make them extra special.  \n\nAll in all, this was a great dining experience!  I haven't been to dinner in downtown in quite a while and wasn't sure what to expect from the hit-or-miss establishments down there - but this place is a gem!
Mingo is definitely a hidden gem in Downtown Las Vegas! They have a Happy Hour that goes until 7pm with amazing prices. The decor is beautiful and unique, the service and food is wonderful especially the Edamame, Vegetable fried rice, cheese burger, and the grilled cheese was to die for!!! If you haven't been, then you should!!!
From the outside one would not know what to expect walking in, but the lounge was very warm and cozy. The food was great!  The best edamame I've (we've - Staff) have ever tasted. You also have to try the calamari! There were others that we ordered and all tasted very good.  Our Server Leo and Owner Mingo was very attentive to our needs and wants. Hence, the service was excellent as always! Thank you Mingo and Staff. Definitely a satisfied customer and well worth recommending and returning for more goodness!
All hype.... Drinks were average and over priced. Food was so so. Fish tacos were fishy and when mentioned to the waiter he did nothing, besides give us the check immediately. Never going back.
I've visited twice and service at the bar was painfully slow on both occasions. When we dropped in, they weren't particularly busy and it was early evening. Myself and two friends were the only people at the bar yet we waited at least five minutes before a bartender finally appeared to take our drink orders. The guy originally behind the bar did greet us when we arrived and told us he would help us in a few minutes but he had to get kegs out of the back. After he left and the bartender came and asked us what we wanted, I should have realized I was committing to at least a 20 minute wait for the fries I insisted on ordering. Fries are delicious and friend tried the \"Kanye\". Food has always tasted great, staff is very friendly and overall it's a cool little place to check out every so often.
DO NOT go here, I made reservations for a holiday party for 20 people at there sister location MUNDO, they shut down and no one had the decency to call and inform us, now I have to figure out where to take my staff with less than 24 hours notice. Crappy management, no wonder you lost a location.
Ok, I love this place. Their happy hour is a great deal and it goes till 7. Everyone who works there is super friendly. Almost everything on thier menu is good.  Must trys are the chicken sandwich, Notorious Pig, and edamame.
Looking for light bite for a late lunch, we popped into this place.  We ordered off the  generous happy hour menu, and enjoyed one of the cheapest meals we've had on this vacation... and also one of the tastiest.     The only negative, two cheap items were still generous and filling.  :-)\n\nIf this were close to home, we would become regulars!
Went to First Friday again, and this time we roamed around a little bit instead of just hanging out at Bar + Bistro at The Arts Factory. We happened on a sign for a restaurant called Mingo Kitchen and Lounge, so we decided to check it out.\n\nTHE DECOR (4 out of 5)\nMingo has seating both inside and out including an outdoor bar as well. On the inside it seemed pretty dark and dimly lit, kind of like a club. However, we opted to sit at one of the tables outside. Sure it was with plastic chairs and all but I didn't mind. It was a nice evening, and we had a decent view of what was going on near the Arts Factory.\n\nTHE FOOD (4 out of 5)\nI was really impressed with their food offering. We had ordered some edamame ($5) which had garlic, red chiles, lime, ponzu and sesame sea salt that I thought was good. Next was the grilled blue point oysters ($14 for 4 oysters) with garlic greens, ginger jalape?o aioli, bacon bits and red chile sauce that was delicious. And lastly since I was still hungry, I tried the Kanye hot dog ($7) which was a Chicago style bacon wrapped hot dog with pickle relish, onions and peppers which I'll definitely order again. \n\nTHE SERVICE (3 out of 5)\nOur server was nice and helpful with our menu selections but it did seem to take a while to get our order (especially with some of the beer orders). While it did get busier as the night went on, that's no excuse for having to wait sooooo long just to get a drink, right?\n\nOVERALL (4 out 5)\nWell, we've found our new restaurant spot during First Fridays, so if you're there and want an alternative to the food trucks nearby, you should pop in and give the Mingo Kitchen & Lounge a try.
Great food a lot of stuff I never heard of, and food I didn't expect from a bar.\n\nThe decor is nice, very Lady Gaga-ish. I think the tables and chairs look cheap. The chairs are see-through plastic. The tables are narrow and have the edges are SHARP. I bumped my leg sliding into the booth and I had a nice bloody cut and now a bruise. \n\nBut anyway...\n\nWe came for lunch during the work week. All the house lights were up and there were four other people having lunch, plus the owner at the bar. \n\nI loved the sassy menu names and hashtags. If I wasn't working I would've had a cocktail but instead had the opened faced egg sandwich. Dining partners had fried rice and tomato soup + grilled cheese. The grilled cheese was more like bruchetta than grilled cheese. But everything was still really good. Can't wait to come back and try some other menu items.\n\nI'm not giving five stars because of the narrow tables, plastic chairs, awkward leather booths, the cut on my leg, and our waitress (who was very nice) spending to much talk to her friends about this one time at band camp instead of bringing us our check so we could go back to work.
Greatest drinks. Very fun menu and classy feel to the place. Their kitchen opened up on Monday 4/29. I didn't get a chance to order. But their drinks wow. Def try the gossip. We also tried the m\u00e9nage and blow pop. Fun tasty drinks. It's the same owners as Mundo and in tune with that other location this one is classy and very well decorated. Great place to chat and get a drink. I can't wait to go back and try the food.
Some of the best mixed drinks I have ever had. The food is tasty and the happy hour specials are a good deal! Add in the sexxy friendly bartender and you get all 5 stars.
Consistently good, which is the highest compliment I can give a restaurant.\n\nThe menu has two, distinct elements.  The Mexican side (Mundo)  is sophisticated and flavorful.  This isn't typical Mexican fare.  The meats are top-notch, sauces are fresh and creative.  My favorites are the Filet Mignon Chile Relleno and the Taquitos.  Enchiladas are also first rate.\n\nThe other side of the menu is American fare.   Crazy-good hot dogs, burgers and several other good options.  Foodwise, there is something for everyone here.  And the drinks....!\n\nThe staff is friendly and well-managed.  The space is modern and hip.  When the weather is good, the outdoor bar is always open.  After 5 visits, I can say I've never been disappointed.\n\nFinally, a shout-out to Aris and Joy, each of whom have made my meals at the bar really enjoyable.  Service is a big priority at Mingo!
We arrived just after 6, having missed the Happy Hour by minutes. The hostess/waitress kind of hustled us inside without really giving us a chance to check things out and put us at a big table in the back. We were just getting a drink and would have preferred to sit at the bar. There were maybe 6 other people in the whole place besides us, which seemed astonishingly low considering you would expect there to be some sort of a dinner rush and some people still lingering from Happy Hour. There were 4 people at the bar just blankly watching tv with the bartender. No one was really talking; the place would have been totally silent save for the DJ in the corner who was singing along to the music he was playing. It definitely seemed strange to have a guy singing in a corner in a small empty bar on a Tuesday night; I could see it on a busy weekend or something, but it was kind of awkward with so few people around and half of them just watching TV. \n\nWe ordered two drinks; I got a lemon drop martini, and my friend got a specialty drink advertised on the bar, some dragon fruit concoction. Neither of us were impressed. The lemon drop was super sour and didn't seem to have been mixed right. My friend was similarly disappointed with the proportions of her dragon fruit cocktail. \n\nI'll give it points for having a very nice aesthetic on the inside, and the service was really good from the waitress when we sat down, but otherwise this place was a disappointment.
I've tried every bar downtown's food so saying Mingo's is my number 1 means more than fluffy words!  EXCELLENT tapas style (labeled as Big Plates and Small Plates) bar food that's more upscale than most such as rib-eye and my favorite- the brussell sprouts!  The menu also has new stuff as the chef feels inspired.\n\nD\u00e9cor is also a winning factor since it strikes the perfect balance between a crisp modern palette and comfortable, homey touches.  There's even purse hooks and chargers at every bar stool!    \n\nFinally I have to shout out the reason I ever heard of this place-  Ona who bartends every Tuesday with an event specializing in underground dance songs curated by her called Onnaland :).  Of course it's my #1 night to visit for an adorably hashtagged libation and nosh but EVERYONE there from the owner (Mingo) on down is friendly, FAST and fun so you can't not have a good time!\n\nAdd Mingo's for sure to your downtown spots and tag it #eatmixmingo
I had a little extra time between my appointments today. I was busy since morning and had not eaten and it was 1pm!!!  I asked a friend to meet me at Zupas but she wanted to go to Olive Garden instead. So No.... I was passing Sahara then thought to pop in and check out Mingys.  Had not been in quite some time and miss the small bites.. I was seated next to Mingo, George, Chef Robe, and my new friend who is doing the big First Friday for the 3rd!! Its gonna be big guys from what I saw, a lof of activity and fun!...Please come down and enjoy a downtown approach to celebration the Fourth! It will be Festive...\n\nOff the subject I was too hungry I ordered the wedge, my fav sal ever!  Bleu Cheese, Crisp Iceberg Lettuce, tomatoes , egg, and dressing.\nThen I had to have to BANGIN BANG this \nGrilled Cheese and tomato soup. A Kent Night staple!\nI had to leave soon and jet due to my next appt and I will be there next month too for FF as a guest.\n\nI dont drink still and i love them offering creative mocktails out there for those trying to stay sober.\n\nI made to give Handsome Texan George on the way out a \"real\" hug. See you soon!
**Edited**\nRather than updating, unless the service and food standards drop, I'm just going to add on.\n\n10/29/13\nLast night was my first time going to Mingo Kitchen & Lounge.  \n\nWe got there about 6:30, as karaoke night starts at 7ish on Mondays, and we wanted to go sing for a while.\n\nFirst of all, the decor is SO cool.  All black and white, with mirrors, and they were all decorated up for Halloween, too, so there was a great atmosphere for the few days before Halloween.\n\nTheir happy hour lasts till 7pm (I think its from 3pm-7, but I don't remember), and they have discounted prices on beer and some of their food.\n\nTo start, for happy hour, my friend and I ordered: a PBR (for him, not me. ew. lol)  and a Blue Moon (for me).  The Roasted Garlic Shrimp, and the Notorious P.I.G.\n\nSo the Roasted Garlic Shrimp was wonderful.  I want to say it was about 8 medium sized shrimp, in a delightfuly tart lemony garlic sauce, served with garlic toast.  It was awesome, and I loved sopping up the sauce with the bread.\n\nThe Notorious P.I.G.  This was too good to be believed.\nI read the reviews of how good the Kanye dog was, but the Notorious P.I.G was the one that called out to be ordered.\nIts a hotdog with crispy bacon, pickled jalapenos, and HORSERADISH MAC N CHEESE!\nYou wouldn't think that mac n cheese would work on a hotdog, but IT DOES.  \n\nI'd drive all the way downtown JUST for this again. And again. And again.\n\nSo after eating this, I decided that I wanted to try the fish and chips.  \nI'm a fish and chips fanatic, and I always like to try them out at new places.\n\nI really enjoyed these.  The chips were well spiced, and the fish was flavorful.  My only complaint is that the batter was just a tiny bit soggy, but that didn't stop me from enjoying every last bite.\n\nWe also ordered the skirt steak salad.  This one took a while to get to us...the server forgot to put the order in, but honestly...we were having fun singing, so it really wasn't a big deal.  When it arrived, it was worth the wait. \nThe steak was a perfect medium rare, with a fantastic heavy sear on the outside.  The salad was delicately dressed, and everything worked together to create a delicious meal.\n\nThe serving sizes are not huge.    The prices are fair.\n\nThere is also a Yelp deal available when you check in, for 10% off your entree.  \n\nAll in all, it was a great night.\n\nKaraoke was fun, the bartender was super nice, and the food was fantastic.  I may have found my new favorite Monday night spot.\n\n11/5/13\nWent to Mingo again last night for karaoke.\nIt was busier last night than it was last week, which bummed me out...I wanted to post up at the bar to charge my phone.  They have phone chargers all along the bar!\n\nSat at a comfy table and ordered from the happy hour menu:\n\nSpicy Fried chicken wings served with bleu cheese and sriracha.\nI'm not a wing fan.  they're ok, but I don't usually make it a habit to eat wings.\nI'd order these again.  They were delicious!  The sriracha mixed in the bleu cheese is good too. ;)\n\n\"Free Change Chicken.\"\nI'm honestly not sure if this is a typo or not, but whatever its called, its delicious.\nChicken breast AND wing with a kind of a mango salsa (that's what I thought it  was anyway) served with a salad, potatoes and a mediterranian chimichurri. Oh. My. GOD it was awesome.  I devoured it.  Flavorful and moist chicken.  \n\nThe skirt steak on the salad this time was a little overdone, but not inedible.\n\nService was great.  Jason remembered us from the week before, as did George, who I think is the owner or manager. They both went out of their way to greet us. \n\nAnother good night at Mingo!
We happened to stumble upon this place on accident one night and boy I'm glad we did! \n\nWe got there just before happy hour. This place is chic and the decor is purple, grey. I ordered the roasted garlic shrimp that is usually $12 and we paid $8 for happy hour. It comes with 2 pieces of garlic bread and it was delicious! The chef really knows what they're doing! I got a blue moon which was $3 on the happy hour menu. Also they have free wifi (password: theboner), and they have 3 different phone charges (iPhone 4, iPhone 6, android chargers) at EACH seat by the bar. Which was amazing because my phone is always about to die. \n\nPros: really cool location (downtown art district), awesome atmosphere inside, good happy hour menu, sweet decor, free wifi, phone chargers at each seat at the bar! Staff is friendly. \n\nCons: the place overall is pretty small \n\nTip: if you like sweet red wine, the Malbec was absolutely delicious! \n\nWould I go back? Yes! I'm dying to go back in and try some other happy hour menu items
In a town of great bars and restaurant, Mingo truly stands out. Everything I've had here is delicious, I recommend the wings, the skirt steak salad, and the burger (Best in Vegas). Their cocktails are also very tasty. I had the El Diablo and it was very refreshing. The decor is very neat and the outdoor bar is a cool touch. Even on a scorching Vegas day it was in the shade with air blowing so it was comfortable to sit there. The only drawback is that this place is kind of hidden, which is probably not good for their business but it actually adds to the laid back atmosphere of the place.
Love this place! What a find! I will definitely be back, and might make myself a regular! They recently added to the menu from \"Mundo\" the Mexican restaurant that was at the World Market Center downtown.\nLove the ambiance and decor. Service was exceptional, but a true Yelp review must be about the food.....\nThe chopped salad was exceptional. Sometimes the vinaigrette overwhelms the salad, not here.... the dressing is a chipotle vinaigette that compliments the ingredients perfectly, and salad was chopped perfectly.\nThe \"All up in my grill chicken sandwich\" was great! Chicken was cooked perfectly, not dry at all. Cheese complimented without overwhelming the sandwich, and the ciabatta bread was fresh, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside! Homemade \"real\" french fries were also cooked perfectly. \nSaw so many things on the menu that I can't wait to try.......
If I could give zero stars...you know the rest. \nOn first Friday:\nMy friend and I order martinis. When we got our drinks, they came in plastic cups. I told the server I did not want a plastic cup and she said she couldn't give us glasses because it was first Friday. I told her she did not inform us of this beforehand and a martini is simply not a drink served in a plastic cup. I'm not a complete snob - but come on. This is super amateur hour if you think this is ok. She says, \"Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger.\" I looked at her so confused, having been a server myself, I would never say such an idiotic thing to a customer. I told her that we were having dinner and not going anywhere (we were sitting in a booth) so could we not just have our drinks poured into a glass (didn't even ask for them to be remade) but she said she could do nothing about it, we would not get a glass in that restaurant, no way no how. \nMy friend did not want her martini in a plastic cup either, so she said to just get something else that makes sense in a plastic cup. I told the server that I would like to get something else and I did not want the martini anymore (since it was in a plastic cup.) She said \"I'm going to charge you for it whether you take it or not.\" I don't think I've ever had that poor of customer service anywhere in Vegas. This is the town that's supposed to be known for customer service, correct? My friend said, \"wow, you should speak to a manager\" but by that point it was clear I was in a place of riff raff and would probably not get anywhere. I didn't order another drink, but told the server, politely, that she should have told us beforehand that all drinks come in a plastic cup and we would have avoided the whole situation altogether. If it were me, and I had failed to tell a customer that her drink came in a plastic cup and neither of my customers wanted their drinks anymore, I would have done everything in my power to return them, get them comp'd, anything; I would have gone as far as to buy them myself since it would have been my fault and I represent the restaurant I'm working in. But this girl seemed like a rookie and had zero pride in her role at the establishment. Needless to say, neither of us will be returning ever and I've made sure to tell everyone I know about the experience.
Last night was my 3rd time dining at Mingo.  I am a local in Las Vegas who is quite a culinary junkie and my brother is a chef, so I have a pretty \"picky palate.\"  I just love the ambiance in here - and it isn't pretentious or stuffy, which I love about these new downtown restaurants!  I was most impressed this time.  I tried the infamous Brussel Sprouts and had some of the specialty cocktails.  Delicious and creative! The bartender was extremely friendly and actually made our night!  What a nice guy!  He made sure we went home hydrated with complimentary bottles of water and even called a cab for us to make sure my boyfriend and I got home safely..... He just anticipated every possible need and (quite honestly) went above and beyond.  Thank you Mingo for another fabulous dining experience. :-)
I'm SO happy boyfriend and I stopped in here for valentines lunch! The owner is amazing we chatted while I sipped on a yummy drink. I had the best fried egg sandwich ever. Everything about it was great. Thick bacon cooked perfectly, yummy avocado, egg was perfect, and the most amazing Texas toast! We got an order of their edamame which was most delectable ! Finger licking good!! I'm glad we came when we did because there was no one in there and we were able to chat with the owner and staff who were great. I can't wait to come back when it's crowded! Thank you for a delicious meal and great company xxxo
I came in late one night for good cocktails and food. Read mixed reviews but was hoping for success. The decor is great and it ends there. The drinks were ok, nothing special. The server took forever to come over and then rushed me out. Maybe I needed to come for happy hour or already be drunk. Noticed the owner writes pretty awful comments back so debated writing this. Bad business management on his end but that speaks for itself.
I was not a fan of the service or ambiance at Mingo.  Maybe it was because I came during the day, but the atmosphere seemed super clubby and pretentious.  The service was sub par, as our server helped other tables multiple times before coming to ask if we needed anything.  The server also asked for our order as soon as he came for the drink order.  When we asked for a few minutes, he did not return for almost 15.  We also waited for approximately 20 minutes on appetizers.  When we asked our server about them, the look of horror/realization that he had likely not entered our order was obvious.  Lastly, we also made reservations that day, but when we arrived there was no reservation in our name.\n\nThat said, the food at Mingo was delicious.  I loved the sriracha ketchup as well as the Kanye dog.
Had a great lunch here yesterday. I enjoyed the notorious P.I.G. while my friend thought the Cubanwich was awesome. Great, friendly service.  Will be back.
The food was good really nice waitress. Me and my family are new to las vegas and she gave us good directions and where to park on the strip and downtown
OMG the fish tacos are absolutely exquisite! Yummy. The seared Brussel sprouts hit the spot for our need to have some greenery. \n\nThe hot dog had a rich flavor and in a bed of arugula with jalape?o peppers! Yummy.\n\nWaiter was attentive, and we got a chance to meet the owner! \n\nGreat place with unusual decor for lunch.\n\nWifi password is, uh, very unique. Lol.
First off, the fact that it's kind of a hidden location makes this place a gem in the ruff. But as you walk in, the decor itself has a very goth/early euro. The deep purple and black colors make it very intriguing. Then they drop the menus and the names for all the items from the food to the drinks give you a giggle. Their menu is not for the conservative at heart. With names like N.O.T.O.R.I.U.S Pig or THE KANYE, drink names like THE BONER and JACK MY D, leaves people with dirty imaginations even dirtier minds. I enjoyed the BLOW POP which was quite delish. Me and my friend ordered their fried rice, edamame, ono fish and chips, and roasted garlic shrimp. Edamame was spicy so I didn't have much of it. The ono fish and chips were good, nothing outstanding to write home about. The garlic shrimp went well with the fried rice, though the fried rice was overly oily. All this for two people was A LOT. We could've done without the rice but our waiter suggested it with the shrimp. Service was good and attentive. They have sit down tables and a bar inside and outside. If you're looking for a good spot to chill in the art district, that's your place.
Mingo's is a hidden gem! They got me with the menu and they kept me with the excellent food/drinks!!!! \nMenu is funny and hip with hashtags that describe the exceptional food in an exceptional way... #TossedSalad! Lol! \nI was reading other reviews that raved about how great Mingo's is but only gave 4 stars? #Lame\nIf you are looking for something awesomely different- Mingo's won't disappoint!
Overall the food and drinks are amazing (especially the fish tacos.) great location as well. I was hosting a bottomless mimosas event with house music djs here every saturday last year with a friend and started them up again this year but after an altercation with the restaurant owner and one of my guests over something petty it was canceled. Unfortunately all of my guests as soon as they arrived to the bar, told me they felt the owner was being a tad bit rude. I felt he was just stressed but still no way to act with your guests. Everyone has the right to refuse service but do it professionally and dont cause a scene. Now im on the lookout for a new place to host these events because people are excited for the next one.
This place was a joke. Made an attempt to have a bite to eat with my fiancee last night on first Friday and waited 20-30 min to be seated. Finally seated and nothing. Another 15 more min and we walked out. Looked around and noticed empty tables. Are you kidding me? I was told by the hostess that they were short staffed. No idea how the food was but the service was completely unacceptable!!! Unfortunate because they had a decent menu but we will never know. Maybe someone could have taken our drink order to at least acknowledge us? Will not be back. Enter at your own risk!!! Maybe we were not the right couple to frequent their establishment.
Cool place to eat some appetizers and get some drinks. Chill vibe goes with the area which is located in the Art District. The calamari is delicious and their happy hour menu is really good with good prices!
This was my second trip to Mingo. I love the restaurant. Fun atmosphere. Jason who works at the bar is fantastic. I had the land and sea, fish tacos, and the Brussels sprouts. The sprouts are amazing. Even if you think you don't like them, you will love them. I would highly recommend getting off the strip and coming to this fun restaurant.
Great place if you are looking to get off the strip and checkout the Art District. Food was authentic and decor was funky. Will visit again.
Amazing once again. The Alien Mule (or two), the Brussels sprouts, ribeye, mahi tacos. All wonderfully good.
First the positive.  Atmosphere really is 5 star.  It is trendy, eclectic, unique - all of these rolled into one.  This was our first time, and we loved the decor.  We also liked the food.  The menu is certainly unique, and most of the items we had were excellent.  Also can't beat the prices for the quality of the food.\n\nThe problem was in the service.  We went on a weeknight, and fairly early, and it was not crowded.  It took forever for our server to come.  She seemed more interested in chatting with some of the regulars, than working.  When she finally did come, she seemed very preoccupied.  When we asked questions on the menu, she did not seem to know the answers, and some of the answers proved to be incorrect.  She brought out wrong items, and rarely checked back.  She was very friendly, just  perhaps having an off night.\n\nWe will try again, and hope for better service, as the food and atmosphere make it worth a second try.
Love the location as it is close to office and home.  Can't bea he great drinks which are fun and taste good, can't just have one and of course the he FOOD!!! AMAZING flavor!  One of my new favorite places downown and a must go for everybody!!
I've been Impressed each time I come here. The artsy Latin chic decor and menu gives this place a warm charm. People are always freindly- customers and staff members alike. The food is incredible and affordable. Their street tacos are the best in the valley. Try the Vegetarian version. You will NOT be disappointed! They also now offer select menu items from the \"Mundo\" menu (a former restaurant recenty closed in the World Market.) Comfort Foods and Latin Chic. It's like being at a your Cool uncles house for a party. They have a great bar and knowledgable barstaff ready to make your tequila cocktails. They even have their special label - MINGOS PBR- that is all the rage. This place gets crazy on the \"First Friday's\" of the month. The streets are closed to create a temporary outdoor shopping and entertainment venue  in the arts district. It's a great place to eat before the smith center. Reservations recommended. Great food, great people, excellent prices
Mingo has been on my list since it opened.  With its close proximity to the Art Square Theatre, I had always planned to go there before a play.  That's what I did last night.\n\nI got there a little after 6 PM and I found out that Happy Hour was until 7 PM.  I ordered the Notorious P.I.G. which is a hot dog with bacon, pickled jalape?o rounds, and horseradish macaroni and cheese all on a hot dog bun.  It was quite good.  The hot dog was grilled and the bacon and jalape?o slices added to the flavor.  I didn't taste much horseradish in the mac and cheese.  I was hoping for a kick, but it just wasn't there.  Along with Notorious P.I.G., I ordered a side of fries.  These were great!  Nicely seasoned with just the right amount of salt.  Very flavorful.\n\nOf course, I couldn't leave without dessert so I ordered their chocolate crunch which is about a 2 inch by 1 1/2 inch round of chocolate mousse that has been covered with melted chocolate and then hardened.  You crack through the chocolate exterior--the crunch--to get to the mousse inside.  It was very good.  There was some mango syrup on the plate and a few slices of fresh strawberry.  A great ending to the meal.\n\nService was good.  My server, Eddie, was around to refill my iced tea several times and was very helpful.  The place is relatively small.  When I come back, I'll opt for a high top table.  Where I sat was very comfortable until you eat.  You sit low and have to lean forward and up to reach the table.
Very cool place. Came here for early dinner during Happy Hour on a Thursday. $3-4 drafts, wuuut!? Pour me another!\n\nI had The Kanye (bacon wrapped Chicago-styled dog with garnishing). It was pretty big--I ended up eating with a knife and fork. I was very impressed that the bacon stayed crusted on the dog (it usually falls off). For appetizers to share, we had seared brussel sprouts (best brussel sprouts I've ever had, and I don't normally like them), roasted garlic shrimp (very garlicky with a hint of citrus), and spicy fried wings (nice and crispy, although they were kind of small).\n\nService was friendly, and bathrooms were clean. The menu (and drink) items were thoughtful: better than just \"bar food\" but not too experimental. Most of all, the price was right!
Hidden in plain sight! - Take heed and bookmark Mingo. \n\nCame here with the lady after a long day of running errands and needed some nourishment and an adult beverage, Mingo to the rescue! This eatery is located in the Arts District, in a huddle mass of amazing art venues and great boutique shopping options. \n\nMingo offers an amalgam of upscale bar food, weiner jokes, and tasty cocktails. We pretty much had the entire place to ourselves and bellied up to the bar. Roman, our bartender greeted us and started us off with couple beers and three-dollar mystery shots. These mystery shots were very good, I'm guessing; Vodka, lemonade, and something else?  Mingo has a decent beer options, but you're better off ordering cocktails in this joint. They have a huge selection and are also willing to create stuff on the fly. \n\nHappy hour was going strong so we ordered accordingly. We got the Notorious P.I.G., Three Cheese Baked Mac N' Cheese, and Brussel Sprouts with Bacon. \n\nThe Notorious P.I.G. is a basically a hot dog covered in awesome. That awesome being, pickled jalape?os, horseradish mac & cheese, and crispy bacon. I did attempt to pick this beast up and eat it the classic hot dog way, but this mammoth meal needed a fork and knife. There's some great texture going on here, the crispy bacon mixed with the creamy mac n' cheese was stellar! This dish wasn't too spicy even with the jalapenos and horseradish; it just had a baby kick. More flavor than anything.\n\nThe seared brussel sprouts were a great side dish for the meal. Even though it says, \"seared\" on the menu these green veggies weren't overcooked. Mingo lightly seared these in a balsamic reduction, and added candied pecans, golden raisins along with bacon upon request. Crispy, fresh, and even with the addition of bacon these lighten up the meal nicely. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place for a daytime adult beverage stop. I hear that soon they will be hosting movie night on Wednesdays! \n\nStay tuned Mingo-ites!
We tried Mingo's again, and they must have a new chef.  Keep in mind I ordered a salad and Brussel sprouts. But both were very good. I would go here again, but keeping in mind what is good there.
The alien mule is the best drink I've had in Vegas! Cool, quiet vibe. And very friendly service!
I read about this place opening a while back and was intrigued by the concept/menu, but just made it down this past weekend. The food was excellent in both value and quality. The options were divided into \"Big Bites\" & \"small bites\" and mostly what I would define as comfort food. I shard the (seasoned) edemame and grilled oysters and both are delicious. A couple beers later (good tap selection of craft beers and popular favorites) I opted for the Kanye dog and was not disappointed. The ambiance was great - I like the courtyard/patio area and the inside looked cool (if a little dark/clubby). The service was fine and friendly. I will definitely be going back to try some of their other offerings that looked tasty - such as grilled cheese and tomato soup and the Notorious P.I.G dog.
What were they thinking? First of all, all chefs agree that you can't fry chicken in olive oil. The smoke point is way too low. What you end up with an unpleasant taste, or chicken that is soaking in oil. To mask the unpleasant taste they apply a horrendous concoction of spices that do not go together, slathered in some kind of mutant Cajun hot sauce. A simple rule for fried chicken seasoning, salt and pepper, that's it. \n\nThe waffle fries were also oil soaked and, once again illustrating that olive oil is not for frying based on the bad taste and strange seasonings.\n\nAdd on the price for what you get and Oliver's chicken is a bust.
I thought I would give this  place a  try since I was in the mall and it was new plus I love chicken.\n\nThe food was good I had a 3 piece chicken meal a bit pricier than most chicken spots but it was good.
I know it's mall good but holy crap. No. Never again. \nWay overpriced for the small portions you receive, the staff is rude and unprofessional and the food is very bland.
When the space in Concord Mills Mall was occupied by Popeyes Chicken,  there was often a long wait after ordering. But the food was pretty good. Oliver Chicken now is in the same spot. They have taken the slow service aspect of Popeyes and integrated it seamlessly with almost inedible food. Dry chicken. That special flavor you get when the fry oil hasn't been changed in a while.  And onion rings that exist. Coca Cola was easily the best thing about the meal, so thank you Coke for quenching my thirst after the abomination that was Olivers Chicken. Oh yeah,  and thank you salt packets for helping make the food have even a semblance of edibility.  Do yourself a favor and eat the napkins, they are free and with the salt taste pretty good comparatively.
Not good at all. Whose idea was it to replace Popeye's with this place? The waffle fries were crispy and drenched in grease and the tasteless chicken was also drenched. How does a chicken place run out of breasts and ketchup???
Only giving one star because it's as low as it goes.  First the staff is the most unfriendly I have ever encountered.  Girl at register didn't even great us. Guy behind counter was playing more than working. Five people total working and with us as the only customer they were slow.  We ordered 2 chicken tender plates and 2 drinks. $24.00. They were out of sweet potato fries as they opened at 12:00 pm.  After ordering we took our drinks to the table. The coke was flat. Was summoned over to find out they have no Mac and cheese.  I asked for refund for meals and they couldn't even run the register for that. Had to get manager to refund our money. \n\nShould've know better since they had no one in line at noon. Never again.  Don't waste your time.
Chicken waffle! Yes..yes..yes. I make it at home at time, however, their chicken is phenomenal. The only problem at this location was that there was a worker who put in one waffle french fry in the sack one at a time. It was absolutely ridiculous how long one had to wait for fast food. All people waiting wanted to jump behind the counter and show em how its done! The fries were not good, but the chicken was great. For a fast food restaurant-- it is decent. But it is a fast food restaurant after all.
You can tell they use real chicken here, but the waffle fries are terrible, and as real as the chicken tasted, it was still bland it tasteless. it doesn't compare to the Popeye's that used to be in it's place.\nI will not he eating here again
Slow service (15 minute wait for fast food at a mall)\n\nBlah sandwich. Roll tasted like wonder bread.\n\nNot cheap.\n\nNot eating there again.
New concept, similar to Chick-Fil-A but they use olive oil instead of peanut oil to fry their food. \nIt's great food but if you compare to larger nationals you will be disappointed. I like that they have tons of sides and combo choices. The serve chicken & waffles! There is also traditional fried chicken on the menu.
Great Gyros! Its a hidden secret. Yum! Cheap prices too.
Great casual fast food type place.  I like the chicken filet sandwich.   Very reasonable pricing.  Lost of airline employees here, kinda thier secret little place.
Use to go here all the time for lunch. Always crowded at lunch time. Everyone that worked there was very friendly.  Had good fish sandwiches, great fried okra and fried chicken wings (big ones). And yes, it is a hole in the wall.
Never even heard of this place, but apparently this is a popular joint for airport employees and Air Force workers across the street. It's another hole in the wall burger/sandwich place (I love them!). It looks a little dumpy on the outside, which never scares me off. The inside was just as bad looking, can we say tacky all the way? What they lack in decor, however, they make it up with low prices and big portion of food. My gyro was $4.75 and came with a side. It was good too, the slices of gyro was still warm, stuffed in a soft warm pita with plenty of lettuce, tomato & onion and tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki sauce was a good compliment to the sandwich instead of being a distraction (sometimes they are too tart or garlicky or herby). The onion rings were the typical frozen corn meal ones, so I say stick with fries instead... why can't I be pleasantly surprised with beer batter ones?!  \n\nAll in all, this is a great cheap place to eat near the airport even for a non airport area employee like myself.
My favorite spot to grab lunch in CLT. EVERYTHING is good here. Very consistent. I've been probably a hundred times or more in the last 9 years or so. Very good and very cheep!
Awesome Philly cheese chicken sandwich and fries.  Great for lunch!  Small eatery feel. Friendly staff
The Philly steak sandwich is very good, and the meat has a nice gyro flavor to it. My husband had a double cheeseburger with everything and really liked it. Don't be scared off by how the place looks. The food is very good and reasonably priced
Terrible! I'm just now getting over this horrible stomach bug caused by his place. I ended up paying $10.92 for a salad, water, and a small tiramisu. Needless to say, that price is ridiculous! You should never have to pay that much at lunch time for that little amount of food. \n\nSpeaking of the food, in the salad, there was an egg and so I out it on a napkin because I don't like eggs. The waitress came by and asked how it was and I told her that I didn't like the egg. Instead of taking it or saying \"hey sorry about that\" or something to the effect, she just walked off. \n\nThe tiramisu was awful, it tasted like someone tried to make banana pudding and failed. If you like tiramisu like I do, go to Olive Garden or SAMs club around Christmas. You will not be disappointed like you will here. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm never going back.
They have one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I have ever had.  I was blocked in traffic due to the president taking off at the airport, so when I ordered my food to pick up, they literally brought it out to my car for me.  They are the nicest people.
This is a well kept secret, serving size is awesome, flavors on point, great sweet tea.  This is spot of the flight crew,etc.  I discovered this space will with USAir.  You gotta go.
Sanitary score too low.... Crime Scene Tape on the front porch
This is one of those local hidden gems.  Could the walls use a painting?  Probably.  Could the interior be slightly updated?  Probably.  Does any of it matter?  Probably not.  The sanitation grade was 96.  The food is cheap, good, and fast, and the people are friendly.  Order at the front and they will bring the order to your table.  $5.05 plus tax for a killer steak pita dripping with mayo and dressing plus a bunch of good fries?  I'll be back.
So, it seems that I order breakfast a lot from this place because I literally call in my order and before I can offer my name, the voice on the other end says: \"Thanks, Michelle! We'll see you in a few minutes!\"  Geez!  Am I that predictable? lol  Honestly, I think they take time to remember the regulars and that says something to me... The food is priced fairly, tastes great and doesn't leave me ready to slump over my desk after I finish it... I've been for lunch a few times and it was great as well, but I truly enjoy their breakfast special (one egg, one meat, grits or hashbrowns and toast for around $3)... Their lemonade is also worth a shot... It's not too sour or too sweet, just the way I like it...
We just ate here for the 1st time today and it was really good. The food is great and I couldn't believe the cheap prices.  Its definitely a hole in the wall but the staff is very friendly.
Fried Okra and Sweet Sweet Tea!  That's all you really need to know, well at least for me that was really the only things on the menu that I could eat.  This place is big on burgers and chicken sandwiches.  My friend said that his burger was extra juicy with a meaty tomato stacked on top.  Carnivores love it!  The fried okra was great, a staple southern side, and the sweet tea is very sweet.  If you are from the north, don't mess with it start with something a little more bland.  I like my sweet tea to taste like sugar water and lemons.  This is a good place to go for a quick lunch.
The grease pit is pretty good! Service is alright they get so busy they rush around hit the food is good.
I almost hate to write a good review......because I will let my little secret gem be found by the masses.\n\nSo, let's just start this by saying that this place was started in 1987.  It's tucked away off the road, right across from the NC National Guard Armory on Morris Field Drive, near the NC Aviation Museum.\n\nFrom the outside, the place shows its age, and as I see it, these folks are just too darn busy cooking up some good food, to tend to the classic vintage facade.\n\nThe inside is your classic 80's area seating....nice comfortable vinyl seats. I do mostly take out here only because my coworkers love this place, and we just do not get enough time to enjoy it here.  You need to get there early, because after 11:30 the place gets packed.\n\nThe food is consistently good and always ready when I get there.  I have always been pleased with the service, quality, and speed at which these folks operate.\n\nOk, so, take my advice, eat here, but please do me a favor and wait till after 11:30am,  so I do not feel so bad about letting you know my favorite little eating place during the week.\n\nI have enclosed a few pictures for your savory enjoyment.\n\nNCFoodGuy
My co-worker's have been raving about this place. Seriously. They went 3 times in one week. So I just had to find out what all the hype was about! \n\nWe arrived a little before lunch and this place was already packed. Now, it's definitely the definition of a \"hole in the wall\" kinda place. Don't go expecting anything fancy. \n\nBut hey it's quick and cheap. \n\nI ordered the philly cheese steak and fries (guys, they have the GOOD fries) . It took them no time to cook it up and send it out and it was good. I had no complaints - and the service was great! Not to mention the portion sizes here are great for the prices they charge. \n\nIf you're looking for something quick and cheap this is your place!
The best bang for your buck... Literally! Cheapest meal for one of the best taste in the area... Serving great all American dishes like burgers and such...
They deserve LESS than 1 star. I decided to get the Korean BBQ menu with 3 other friends. After cooking some meat, our BBQ plate needed to be replaced and we pointed it out to the waitress. When we did, she said \"I know, I know\". It took maybe 30 minutes for her to give us more water. Most meats were unmarinated (e.g. wasn't richly seasoned as per their menu), all BBQ plates came ungreased making meats prone to sticking and the plate burning. She and the owner were micromanagers, that is: monitoring how you use their stove. They seem to not care at all about replenishing your water, side dishes or utensils. The cost of the above was around $27 per person - cash only - and the waitress actually counted our payment to make sure we gave a tip. They are overpriced for probably the worst service I've had so far - regardless of cuisine - in Toronto. Contrary to its name, there's nothing really \"real\" about this restaurant, other than real bad service. You're honestly much better off just ordering a bucket of chicken from KFC if you're craving meat.
The worst Korean BBQ I ever had. The All-You-Can-Eat option is really really a bad choice, for that it does not have the varieties, and they would easily run out of your appetite. In addition, no real waitor seems to present there, instead just the owner and an old lady.
Why is this place still even open? If you're even thinking about going here, DONT. If you're there right now, RUN. It's even more embarrassing that its run by Korean people and in Korea Town.
My friend and I walked it craving a korean bbq. First it smelled like fish inside an there were plates on the table next to us, probably the staff's dinner. They could have taken it away right away...\n\nThe menu is very confusing as to what you can and mostly what you can't have. We took the $25 AYCE special because the special #1 didn't include appetizers and other stuff.\nSo you can order 3 types of meat (for the two people), not 3 types each and small portions no no! Same you can pick one appetizer for 2. \n\nFood came in a very random order. One soup and then oh a bit of meat, after 20min here is the rice (we asked for it).\nWe had 3 huge piles of meat. Meat was marinated and good but not thinly chopped at all. The opposite. I don't know if it's how it's supposed to be for korean bbq but I did not like that.\nThe only veggie we had was lettuce and there were no sauces. Makes it even harder to finish all that meat... \nI feel like it's AYCE but they just try to stuff you with meat. I would like smaller portions of meat but a wider variety.\nAs for the taste of the food itself, it was ok i guess.\n\nServer was nice at least.\n\nMy biggest issue with this place is that it looks very unsanitary. Will not come back.\n\nAlso, they only take cash. There is an ATM in the restaurant with a $1.50 fee
