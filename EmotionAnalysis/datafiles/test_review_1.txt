Love the food but it's great at all locations. The customer service is horrible at this location. Only two tables were occupied at the time we walked in for a carry out. We walked in and they looked at us like.....really? Go away!! Someone walked up to the register and he just looked at me. I asked him if he was ready to take my order and he just kept looking at me like I was wasting his time.  No thank you, nothing. Just a hand to take my money and then a bag in my face so I would leave and get out of their faces. Really???
The fish croquette, pork belly and collard greens price fixe for $35 were to die for. Uncorking two bottles of Chateauneuf du Pape for free was simply priceless.  I am just not used to actually getting such value for money at restaurants in Toronto.
First time here since the Sang's Chinese restaurant at this location closed. Nice 50's decor in Coca-Cola red, white and black. Black marble table tops and black metal chairs. The burgers are a 10 for taste, freshness, all fresh toppings and juiciness say both my daughter and I. My daughter loves the soft fresh sesame buns and wants to know where the owner buys them. The fries are the old fashioned hand cut fresh kind and yes, they do have malt vinegar as well as white vinegar, which \"chips\" IMO should have in a good burger place (daughter of an Englishwoman here). Quite reasonable prices. Single cheeseburger combo with a can of Coke or other soft drink $8.85. Add $1.00 for bottled pop. You order your burger & fries at the back counter and take your can/bottle of pop from the fridge opposite the counter. The owner says he's trying to cook things the old fashioned way and welcomes customer feedback. I wanted to try the dessert of the day but unfortunately all they had was Nutella milkshake, and I don't like Nutella. Apparently they had an Oreo cheesecake cupcake yesterday but were sold out of it. I gotta try that!
Great selection of fairly-priced teas. Good food, too. Could be bigger, but never had a problem finding a comfortable seat. Not much to say, check it out!
Started going to the Te' when they first opened. The two ladies that run the place are very nice and good to talk to.\n\nThe teas are excellent! I have yet to find a better place to get good, loose leaf tea. The presentation is top notch and the variety is excellent.\n\nThe atmosphere of this little tea shop cannot be described. I would stop by towards the end of the day to finish up some work. The relaxed setting and fairly quiet place made it easy to focus and get things done.\n\nI don't work in the area anymore, but I'll use any excuse to get back there.\n\nSeriously, it is worth fighting to find a parking spot in Squirrel Hill for this place.
It has been awhile since I've been to Golden Krust and I remembered this place being pretty good but things have sadly changed. Walking into the restaurant it was extremely humid and hot so I assume the air condition was not working. My family and I proceeded to order since we were starving. We ordered the Curry chicken with rice and beans and cabbage, Oxtails with rice and beans and cabbage and Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and cabbage. We also added 2 spicy beef pattys, they did not have any more regular beef pattys, I was disappointed. With it being so hot in the restaurant I wanted a Large ice water BUT their fountain drink machine was not working and they did not have any bottle waters. The only drinks that were available were bottled juices that I was not interested in. So I walked over to Shane's to buy a large drink. After returning with my large drink in hand my family and I ate dinner. The curry chicken was my favorite out of all the entrees we ordered but I was disappointed in my plantains were very soggy and not fried long enough. The oxtails disappointed me the most. They were not seasoned and did not really have a taste. Overall my experience here was just ok, I hope Golden Krust improves the obvious issues and bring back the original Golden Krust.
First impression is that this place is very clean but a little confusing- you walk in and see a buffet-type set up, but it's not being utilized and looks like there's a lot of junk around the kitchen area. I was immediately greeted and handed a menu, which has American breakfast specialties on the front, and inside is a small kabob selection, naan pizzas, and burgers. Very odd combination of offerings.\n\nOrdered the chicken kabob platter to go, and was offered a breaded chicken wing to sample while I waited- they are trying out new menu items. The wing was huge and mostly composed of breading, which is not what I'm looking for at all when I'm ordering wings. Flavor was okay, but the wing itself was just weird.\n\nGot home with my food in a reasonable amount of time and it was nice and hot- the kabobs were delicious, and my BF snagged a few bites even after devouring his sandwich. The rice in particular was very good: I'm not one to rave about rice, but it was moist and flavorful, and had some white, some yellow, and some orange in it- likely a combination of white and saffron rice, with additional seasonings. The naan and salad were also fresh, and the portion was generous, and on par with the $10 total. Best part of the meal was the cilantro sauce for the kabobs- it was killer. Highly recommend, get it on anything.
We had a light dinner here, it was fantastic! Fresh seafood at it's finest. Started out with Arran Smoked Salmon with Potato Scones, Cr\u00e8me Fra?che and Chives, the salmon was so fresh, it melted in your mouth. We also split a kg of the Scottish Mussels, we chose Shallots, White Wine, Garlic & Cream sauce, don't forget to order some bread to dip into the pot and soak up the goodness. This was probably one of the best mussels pots I've had. \n\nCall and make a reservation if you can, we waited 45 minutes for a table (we went over to the Bow Bar to pass the time). If you can, sit outside, great people watching, right in the heart of Grassmarket.
Very tasty food, great beer and really friendly service!!
Great concept.  Food is good-fun menu and terrific custard desserts.  Drive-in service as well as indoor/outdoor seating.  Firepit for cooler nights.\nPlan on visiting many more times.   Onion rings are fantastic, hot dogs are good, chicken sandwiches are great!
This place is great for a late night drink food run. The line can be long but is worth it. If you do come with a large group order the large pack.
This was our family's Christmas Day Lunch/Dinner (depending on what time you eat lunch/dinner). Seeing as my wife and I both love White Castle and there is not one no where near where we stay, this one was GREAT.
This small square burgers are a joke. This mini burgers aren't clean and made me and my family go toilet three times. The tables aren't clean. It is way overprice and it's not even funny. It's over hype. Don't come here. My stomach still hurts from this shit these mass production tiny burgers are. Please don't come here. The kumer movie is fake. That's why I came here. It's tastes horrible. Other customers are saying it's a joke. This place is not clean.
Ever since I was a kid listening to the Beastie Boys rap about White Castle, I have always wanted to go there. Living in So Cal, we don't have the opportunity.  Low and behold signs on the way to Vegas advertising for White Castle. \n\nNo traffic, no crowds, no parking issue was going to keep us from going.  Park behind and walk to the front of the strip location. \n\nThe customer service was great, the location is clean and inviting and the food was so, so delicious.\n\nThe burgers were just as good as I had hoped, and the dipping sauce zangy sauce was OUTSTANDING.  I tried to find a copycat recipe of it online, but have failed.  \n\nI will definitely, be back when in Vegas again! \n\nLove White Castle.
White Castle in Vegas ? Whaaaat ?  oh yeh, these were amazing little burgers.  I've had these when I was in Ohio a few years ago and haven't seen a real location out on this coast except in Vegas.  Give them a try.
I dont get it....sorry. Tasteless little nuggets of some kinda meat, and fries that are no better than Del Taco. Service was friendly and quick and she asked if I were a local (which I am) so she gave me a little discount. Not sure what the appeal is but I'd pass on by next time. Even in a drunken hunger this place didn't satisfy.
First time ever at a White Castle.  Had to see what all the hype was about.  Quick fast food.  Tasty little sliders especially after a night of Vegas drinking.
I gave into the hype. I just had to, even though reviews weren't great. Well, shocker, White Castle wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Burgers are basic but just really taste like bread. Fries were plain jane. No ranch dressing available to dip any of this in to make it better! \n\nNow I can say I've been to White Castle, an I definitely don't have to go again!
Currently drunk,  hungover or nearly out of money should be the only reason to stop here.  It does the job of filling you up for a low price.  Nothing special except for the people watching.
The worst burger I have ever had in my life. The sogginess of the burger meat and the bottom bun was repulsive. Will never go there again.
It was just what I expected. The line was long but they served us fast. The burgers were fresh and hot. The order was made correctly and the environment was cleaned.
I've never had White Castle and when I saw it on the strip and it was close by our hotel, I decided to stop in.  The line up was long and took about 20 minutes from entering to leaving with my food.  I'm not familiar with their sliders so I decided to get 3 of them and a regular fries.  I thought if I couldn't eat them all, I would share with my husband.  The line up to order was the longest wait, but the cashier was friendly.  After I waited on the side for my order number to be called.  It seems to be an efficient process with staff doing their part of the assembly line to get the food ready and placed in bags.  The woman who calls out the number also provides ketchup packets and is friendly.\n\nWhen I got back to the hotel, I was disappointed with the food.  Each slide had a pickle and onions but the beef didn't look and taste very appetizing.  I was hungry so I did eat up eating all my food but now that I've tried it once, I know I never have to go back.  There's too many other great restaurants and food to be had in Vegas so I'll keep walking by next time I'm in the area.
White Castle goes one of two ways typically.  People are either fanatics or hate it.  Personally, I fall in the former category.  Their fries are delicious, the sliders are unique, offering a steamed variation on the burger.  And the toppings are minimal yet effective.  For the first time, I got a chicken ring sliders which was pretty good and seemed to offer a sizable piece of chicken.  In N' Out may be a little better, but White Castle is great as well.  Having the closest location to Los Angeles, I stopped at the Vegas White Castle for a Crave Case.  I went for the Cheeseburger Sliders, which run about $41 for a case of 30.  Although I remember them having ketchup, when I asked for them to hold the ketchup, I was informed they came without ketchup, but did have pickles which I did not remember.  These ones were not quite as steamed or good as some of the east coast locations, but hey, I'm eating White Castle so who am I to complain?!  I'm not sure that the pickles were needed and as they sit in my freezer while I work my way through the case, I may regret getting a smaller order and going for the frozen ones at home, but so far I have yet to be too disappointed.  And if anything the mental appeal and novelty of having an authentic White Castle experience awaiting in my freezer will help give it an edge.
Relatives from Chicago were right - definitely nothing special. \nRecommend everyone try it once to satisfy your curiosity, but the burgers are terribly bland, flavorless, limp, and unexciting. \n\nDrunk friends were not fans as well
I'm from LA and I've never tried White Castle before. I now see that I haven't missed a thing.
No where like the ones in NYC.  No fish sandwich or clam strips. Chocolate shake was almost 6 bucks too.  Which brings me to the fact that the sliders in Vegas are about 45 cents more than the east coast which doesn't surprise me. Food out here in the desert costs more in grocery stores and most fast food chains.  Quality and taste? Well, the slider was on the dry side and the onions didn't exist. I'm not a fan of them anyhow and only stop in to see if the fish and clams are available yet.  Having no other choice, I pick up a few sliders.  Far from the worse place I've ever been, but anyone who's been to the ones in NYC will know the difference.  The \" good ole boys\" here in Vegas think it's a great place to eat and talk all day about \" no state income tax\" here. But that 900 a year to register there truck is fine and dandy along with all the other super inflated city and state fees.  Point is .....ignorance is bliss.  If you don't know what a real White Castle is, you'll be happy.  Every real NY'er I know thinks this Vegas location sucks. Will I be back? Not for a slider. Hopefully the fish and clams will be here.  Then again, they'll probably fuck those up too and charge 40% more for them since we're sitting in this \" rock quarry\" called Las Vegas.
I have liked White Castle since my childhood in Ohio.\n\nIt is great to have it here on the Strip and the doubles are great except for one thing...the cheese tastes slightly different than the White Castles back in the Midwest.
This place deserves every star. Excellent service and even better food. Other Chinese food places in the area are fine but usually disappoint, somehow messing up a seemingly easy order. I find my self looking forward to the next time I stop by and see the extremely friendly AJKs staff again. My new favorite Chinese restaurant! Would highly recommend for family and close friends.
This restaurant does not exist at the stated location.  I used GPS Navigation and everything, but there is nothing there but old houses.
We've tried their food at least half a dozen times and without fail it's been the best Asian food we've found in the valley.  Every dish has been great, the portions are HUGE (they give you your order in a cardboard box!) and the lady that works the front is a sweetheart.\n\nI honestly can't come up with a single negative based on our experiences so far.  Two snaps up!
I'm a huge ramen fan and I was disappointed when I went to Kenzo yesterday. \n\nI had the Kings of King Ramen with a spicy level 2/3. It was really spicy though I'm Chinese and can take a quite a lot of hotness. Moreover, mushrooms and meat in the soup tasted smoky, not in a good way. They tasted like they were over cooked and the fire was way too hot for them. \n\nOverall, I don't think I will ever go back there.
Worth the wait - love this place - lucky if i get it every 5-10 years. You can't go wrong with in-n-out.\nMenu isnt big so just het a burger and fries. I suggest the burger \"animal style\" and pink lemonade if you are't getting a milkshake.
While I think that, overall, Gate 403 is a great bar, the above four stars is not for the bar as a whole, but for the bar on Tuesday Nights.\n\nWhile Gate 403 has a revolving selection of live jazz, for free, every night of the week, Tuesdays are especially great, as they are the night Julian Fauth plays. Tuesdays have been, for the last few years, a regular destination for myself and many others on and off the Roncesvalles strip, due mostly to the fact that Julian's style of blues (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZarpCUeykI, but this doesn't really do the live setting justice) is so great for either letting sink into the background as a wonderful setting for conversation and drinking, or for sitting quietly at the bar and attending to. \n\nBesides that the bar is notable mostly for great and friendly bartenders (except for Kate, who is really great and unfriendly), the fact that there is free music every night, and a good cast of nice regulars.
2.5*.  The food was mediocre.  The service wasn't great.  First, we were put in the small and dark back room (storage room?) when there were empty tables at the back upper section of the main restaurant.  Then they forgot to give us the dim sum menu.  Then we had to ask two times for hot sauce.  The SP dish - curry octopus- was over priced compared to the amount and quality of food received.  Our tea which they charged for was good and the staff was good about ensuring this was filled.  This was our second time there and we will not be returning.  Too many other places to go to in Markham.
COPPER...need I say more?! Its worth buying a large bottle of the beer since the refills are so inexpensive! WOW! Make sure to get the tour and fun explanation of their brewing process. I dig the european concept and feel of the place. Its a good time had by all!
Great beer, good atmosphere, and friendly staff.\n\nWent there to attend a brewery tour, and was blown away by the quality and taste of thier beers.\n\nNice place with an authentic German feel. No food served on a regular basis, although they do have a vendor come in sometimes to sell bratwurst and the like. \n\nThe service is good, the waitresses are quite attentive on making sure you don't run out of beer. \n\nThey have tours on Saturdays, which are interesting and informative. Kind of a small brewery right now, but well laid out and kept in order. \n\nUnfortunately, they only have two year round beers on tap, a Kolsch/Pilsner hybrid and an Altbeer. And only one seasonal at a time; at this time it was the summer seasonal. They haven't done any one offs or specialty beers to help fill out the tap list. \n\nIt really is a nice place that is comfortable to hang out with some friends and have a few beers. The only complaint that I would have is the fact that there are only three beers on thier tap list at any given time, it would be nice to see at least four or five.
This is the best pizza in Phoenix.  I have only been to this location once, but I have been to the Bell/16th St. location numerous times.  Their canolies are amazing too.  They get extremely busy on weekend nights, so plan ahead.  I think they are closed on Sundays or Mondays too.
***Moving to 5509 N 7th St, Phoenix, AZ 85014***\n\nThis location is closing at the end of November 2013 to a new location on 7th St and Missouri. They will offer some great new menu items, as well as introducing a caf\u00e9/marketplace/bakery!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom article at http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2013/11/spinatos_pizzeria_pizza_central_phoenix_restaurant_new.php\n\nThe family-owned local chain that's been making old-school Chicago-style pies in the Valley just shy of 40 years has announced their newest location, a 10,000-square-foot space at 5509 North 7th Street in Central Phoenix (7th Street and Missouri), will officially open Monday, November 25.
A very classy O'Club with good food and a great bar. Make sure to stop in the Check Six for a few drinks.
It's a pity. It was very nice restaurant. Right now I'm having lunch. It's empty. Including us 4 people. Before it was packed. employees look unhappy. I went to washroom. It was dirty. No soap no paper. How did they turn in too bad from an outstanding restaurant it's unbelievable. . It's going to be my last visit.
Motorino Enoteca does have a modern and youth decoration. Loud, high energy and quite chic. I just wish the food and the services can be as high energy as the vibe!\n\nDropping by for a late lunch and the services was just indifferent and slow.\n\nMy Rigatoni alla Norma (Fried eggplant, light tomato sauce and Imported riotta salata) for $16 is not bad in taste but definitely overpriced. \n\nNo bread was ever offered... wish I have that to dip it in the tomato sauce.\n\nMaybe it just me, if I ordered rounds and rounds of drinks, my services maybe a lot better?\n\nThere are so many options of good Italian food in the area, I think I am going to skip Motorino!
This is my go-to place on the square for drinks. They have an amazing beer selection and the waitstaff and bartenders are always really personable. I usually go with my boyfriend, and if we get food, we usually split something, as the entrees are a little pricier. \n\nWe like to be adventurous so a few months back we ordered the bone marrow. It was my first time eating it and it was the first time I've ever ordered something I couldn't eat. It is served in the bone and for some reason, that made it unpalatable to me. It doesn't affect my rating, though, as every other dish we have tried has been excellent. \n\nThe only major gripe I have is that they don't take reservations. I get that they are on the square and will fill up quickly without reservations, but there have been many times I've had to go elsewhere because the wait is 2 hours+. I would love to take friends there when they visit us in Madison, but the wait is just too long. \n\nWe usually end up going on weekdays to get our beers. Overall, awesome place with a few minor pitfalls. They don't keep us from returning, though.
I had been eagerly awaiting the opening of Settebello in Summerlin for some time now and jumped at the chance to go last Wednesday.  I thought their Henderson location was the best pizza I'd had in LV so that's what I expected.  It wasn't the same but it was still pretty good.\n\nLet's start off with the restaurant itself.  The place is big compared to the original and they did an awesome job with the decor, open kitchen and cool bar area.  I look forward to coming back for happy hour multiple times.  $5 mini pizzas among other food deals from 3pm-6pm ensures that.  \n\nSo my wife and I split the \"Panzanella\" salad (House Made Croutons, Cherry Tomato, Prosciutto Crisps, Red Onion, Fennel, Cucumber, Basil, Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Red Wine Vinaigrette) which was good as usual.  I really like the prosciutto crisps since they're basically super bacon bits and could've used more of them but no biggie.   \n\nThen the pizzas came out.  My wife got the Margherita DOC which was topped with fresh buffalo mozzarella as opposed to the regular cheese and well worth the $1-$2 upgrade.  I usually get the Settebello pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) but chose to get the Pizza Carbonara instead.  I should've stuck with the Settebello.  Why mess with perfection?  Pancetta, egg, mozzarella and crushed tomatoes just sounded so good but it didn't come together as well as I was hoping.\n\nFunnily enough, when the waiter came to ask how everything was and we gave our obligatory \"fine\", he just comes out of nowhere and says \"Yeah.  I am kinda conflicted on the carbonara....\" and just walks away.  Hmmmmm.  Not enough pancetta or sauce and the crust wasn't as well done as I wanted it to be.  But after all, it was still pizza and it was good but not the best.  My wife's margherita was great.  \n\nI still have a lot of love for Settebello and look forward to bumping it up to 5 stars.

This place advertises itself as a Noodle House. Because it was 108 degrees outside, I didn't feel like eating hot noodles and/or soup. I ordered the BBQ Combination. For an in a casino food court the presentation is nice. The quality and quantity of food provided was disappointing. It was dry and tough. As compared to Chinatown and factoring the bland unimpressive taste and meager portions, the price would not appeal to the value conscious crowd. But compared to the other eating establishments in this casino food court, the price is on par, about 10 to 12 dollars per plate. \n\nRemember this review is based on the BBQ offerings not the noodles. I assume they should be better. \n\nI do have a concern over the layout. There are to many tables that are too tightly packed. One has to turn sideways as you zigzag between them. They are very high tables with stools with exposed sharp corners.  Only one table is at a height that can be accessed by wheelchair persons. Unfortunately, it's located in the busiest and least accessible part of the restaurant. The path is obstructed by a gauntlet of tables, stools and people standing in line to place their orders. I saw a girl with her mother and brother park the wheelchair under the table because that table was inaccessible. Luckily, she was both strong and light enough that her two companions were able to assist her into a high stool. \n\nStrangely, eating utensils are the customers responsibility of getting from a hidden corner in the front. I would say it was the most frequently asked question I overheard. \n\nThere is a bottomless fountain service for drinks, yeah. But with the slick flooring and lack of any anti-slip matting. It is literally an accident waiting to happen. In the half hour I've been here I saw one of the employees or owners, Linda, almost do a face plant. \n\nI'm looking  forward to trying the noodles in this place  the next time I'm trapped at Silverton. But nothing I've seen induces me to give up my usual noodle spots, Mr. Noodle or Thai Style Noodle House.
We went here this week kind of our last hurrah as we don't plan on staying or gambling at this casino any more (read our review on the casino). We eat Chinese quite often and really love it.  The food here was outstanding!  We had the Pad Thai and WuHu fried rice, both were perfect.  We often eat in china town in Vegas and the food there for the most part is very good, but this was better and at a casino!\n\nThe Resturant is very open to the casino, and yes the chairs are high and a bit tight to get in and out of but overall it was fine when the food came out.  \n\nIf your wanting Chinese, give WuHu a chance, you. Won't be sorry!
Food was amazing. Had the chicken thigh pot pie and Belgium frites. Absolutely perfect. The drink menu had a little bit of everything.  Sat upstairs because the downstairs was packed and had a great time. Staff was attentive and friendly.
Went there two weeks ago because I was extremely hungry and I remember a lot of people talked to me about it so I gave it a try. I took a burger and a Poutine, the burger was alright.. Poutine wad good but not the best I have tasted. To be honest I expected more because of the hype but it is still a great place to eat, I would definitely recommend to people if they are hungry. Place is not big by the way it's really tight and it feels like you are talking to  everyone at the same damn time. The employees are very nice and they definitely treat you with respect, I was also facing the chef so I could see what he was doing which was cool. But yea give it a try guys !
The best! \n\nMe and my boyfriend were visiting Montreal for the first time, we ended up eating here twice!\n\nBoth times we got the burger w/ poutine And salad combo. Such a perfect balanced meal and a great price!  \n\nThe customer service was awesome too, very friendly and helpful!
Great little hole-in-the-wall pizza joint.  Great lunch deals and pizza is New York style thin and tasty.  Love to put a little oregano on it and fold.\n\nCheck out the $1 slice Monday lunch special!
100% best pizza in vegas. Love love love love this place! The owner is the nicest dude ever and super acommodating to vegans. Every employee is always super nice and great. Love this place!
Awesome place for brunch! I came here with a group of friends since we wanted a change from the usual, Cora's, and this place definitely met expectations. I was craving something sweet this day, so I ordered the peanut butter banana waffle with whipped cream (because what new year's resolution...? lol). Great combination of soft and crunchy, and it even came with a bit of fruit on the side (would have loved to have more fruit, but whatever). My friends were more on the savoury side with eggs and toast and bacon. One of them forgot to order her bacon well done, but the waitress was super sweet and friendly and offered to take it back to crisp it some more. Nothing fancy in terms of food, but definitely satisfying overall. When I arrived, there was no line which was perfect for us! But the line grew quickly - so when the other reviewers warn about lines and waiting, they know what they're talking about.  Can't wait to come back for more!
I would highly recommend this restaurant!\nI would also highly recommend making a reservation. We went on a Saturday night at 6:30 and the place was packed.\nGreat atmosphere, great service. I had 3 options I couldn't decide on for dinner - the waiter, Jarrett made his recommendation and I was not disappointed. The Chicken Marsala with Mushroom Risotto was incredible - I kept eating long after I was full. The portions are very generous.\nMy husband ordered the New York Striploin and was very happy with his choice!\nWe will definitely be back - I need to try the other two options on the menu that I couldn't decide on :)
I thought about giving this place 1 star but because their breakfast is pretty good I gave it 2. A lot of people are complaining about the food and I'm surprised more ppl are not complaining about the service. There's one server there who sits and chats with customers and she doesn't come around to see how anything is, you literally have to go up to her and ask for whatever you need. And when you want your receipt none of them are anywhere in sight. \n\nIf you have a lot of time to wait for refills your bill etc then this is a good place to go, if you wanna be in and out this is not a good place.
Went on a Monday morning, and again on Thursday morning.  Both times, decent food, especially the breakfast special.  However both times also horrid waiters--different waiters, but learned from the same school of rudeness--let us stand at the front about 5 minutes while chatting with other employees, then grunted and pointed to a table for us to go to.  Both times the forks were dirty (spoons and knives OK) and we had to ask the waiter to sweep the crumbs off the seats.  We noticed the waitresses were friendly and efficient, but the waiters were the opposite.  We had to go get the waiter to get coffee refills.  Washrooms were tiny and filthy; no TP in the men's.  The first time we tipped as usual, assuming the waiter just had a bad day.  The second time we gave our tip to one of the waitresses who noticed we needed more coffee even though it wasn't her table.  The roasted potatoes were really good, but the home fries were very dry and tasted like they were over baked frozen potatoes.
My boyfriend and I just moved to Phoenix and had struck out with other sushi places in town. We hate those modern loungey/clubby sushi restaurants but Hana was a nice small family owned restaurant that was centrally located. This place hands down won our vote for amazing service and very authentic and tasty sushi! We never had to wait longer than a few minutes for service even though they were packed. Wonderful and skilled sushi chefs got our food out quickly and the presentation and taste was 5 stars. We can't wait to come back!
Hurry up and Leave!\n\nThis was our third visit to Hana because the food is excellent. God forbid you walk in at 8:40pm, 20 minutes until posted hours of closing time. Might as well post closing at 8:30pm as both service and quality decline closer to closing!!!\n\nFist two visits went extremely well and so why not try it a third, right?!?! NO! It was CLEAR by the hostesses reaction that we were not welcome at 840pm as she rolled her eyes and quickly walked away from us. Not a good first impression but we were confident in the food and decided to give it a go. We had a nice bottle of wine and were expecting a wonderful date night and the typical HANA experience... DENIED!\nWe were in and out in less than 40 minutes, $75 for two of us (without tip), not including our bottle of wine we shared one glass of. We found ourselves shoveling food in our faces as the servers were doing all of their side work surrounding us. Very uncomfortable dining experience and disappointing. \n\nI'm not one to post and especially not with a negative review and I WILL go back (before 8pm), but I do believe the owners and future guest should be aware of this situation. Last time I checked if your posted hours are until 9pm, you serve food until 9pm???? Right? Not everyone out by 9pm! Not to mention with your price point, guest are visiting your establishment to enjoy their dinning experience and not be rushed! \n\nWe ended up going to Sochu House for a couple other dishes as we did not get enough to eat and Lord knows my man needs his dessert. Hopefully, next visit will be earlier and better. Know that you have been warned, and enjoy Hana, but go early!!!!!
I went in for lunch after work on the recommendation of a Coworker. I ordered some pork Gyoza, Takoyaki, and a bowl of Yakibuto Ramen in Miso broth. All the food was fantastic. The gyoza was great by itself, but even better with the sauce provided. The Takoyaki was very hot, and the first piece cooked my mouth a bit, but was worth it so I have no regrets! I would definitely order it again. The Ramen came with an option of a variety of broth options. I went with the Miso broth on the waitresses recommendation and it was great. The portion was large and with the other food beforehand I was unable to finish the entire bowl. The waitress was very helpful and friendly as well.\n\nOverall it was a great experience and I would absolutely return for lunch again to try out their other dishes and some of the other broth options for their Ramen. Give them a try if you are in the area!
This cute little cafe is a great place to meet for lunch. They have soups and sandwiches and they even make their own (yummy!) whole grain bread on site. In this day and age I'm surprised that these little cafes survive but I hope that the Den sticks around, it gives the neighbourhood more appeal!
I absolutely love this place!!! Service is always great, especially with Mikey the Don. Everything is amazing here. We catered for our employee recognition event and everyone LOVED it. And their cheesecake is to die for.
UNREMARKABLE is the best rating I can offer. while it has been a few years since I last visited, I had been anticipating a some what better of a dinning experience. It seems no one there knows how to smile or make a guest feel welcome. I had made on line reservations 5 days prior to our visit on 4/27. we arrived a few minutes before our 7 PM reservation by a very disinterested host/manager who offered no greeting other than \"please follow me\". At this time he proceeded to lead us to the outside patio, it was in the mid 90's that day and I had no desire to sit outside. When  I advised him that I would prefer to sit in one of the two open tables in the main dinning room his only comment other than let me check was that there was no preference on my reservation to which I replied that most restaurants ASK if we would like outside dinning.\n\nI followed him back to the host stand where after a moment he said OK take the table in the dinning room,  he made no effort to escort us there and an attitude was clearly shown. It took  a waiter a good 5 minutes to greet us at the table and apologize for being behind and that he would return shortly. From here on the service was painfully slow and other than at the end the server finally said he was sorry that the kitchen was backed up. Mr. Personality that originally sat us was positioned but a few feet from our table the entire meal never did stop by and say hello or say that he was sorry for any seating issues that we incurred.\n\nBy the way, the food was just OK, not worth the 25 minute trip when I have Maggiano's, Carrabba's and Nicks all within two miles of my home. NO one at Pasta Brioni's even tried to make me feel like I was a valued guest. I prefer to spend my $$$$ where my presence is appreciated.\n\nJC
I came here for drinks after Karaoke and they had an excellent selection of cocktails and other late night drinks. The atmosphere was great and the bartenders were very knowledgeable and friendly. It's a very chilled out spot with fun loungey music that makes it feel very intimate. Don't come here expecting to dance or be rowdy, it's not that type of crowd.
The perfect place to down a few bottles of Dieu du Ciel Ros\u00e9e d'Hibiscus in the middle of winter when you're really missing summer. Love the mood lighting and actual candles this place has - full of character without trying too hard.
Exactly! Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nMaybe my expectation was too high after checking all good reviews and reputation of this place on yelp and some magazines. \n\nFoods;\nPretty much every slice of sashimi was stringy even though it's called toro and very uneven surface - for Salmon, Halibut, and Tuna? maybe dull sashimi knife?! \nYellowtail taste good but the sushi looking was not that appetizing\nOysters were way too big and over priced\n\nService was decent and attentive.. nothing super attractive or fascinating..\n\nI'm not really motivated to drive back to this place anymore, so my final verdict of this place is \"Meh\"
What the heck am I missing here?  The rice again was ooey and gooey again on my last visit, sticking to the roof of my mouth and having a waxy feel about it  .... I guess some people like it that way?   I was hoping that it was just a fluke the first time but now also the second time.  Other people's review I trust give it more stars.  I just don't get it.
Best salmon around! Hands down!  They do serve okonomiyaki (when they have the ingredients for it.) And most Japanese street foods. Really amazing dessert menu. Better than Osaka's in Las Vegas. Except they don't have traditional seating.  Call ahead if interested in Street food.
Excited to try this place for the first time as we're  visiting Arizona with the family. CoZy lighting and loud atmosphere with enthusiastic eaters. Ordered ramen with eggs and pork bone broth. Definitely worth the wait and coming back again.
Definitely worth the wait!!!! The staff is awesome, chef is amazing and FYI bring your own wine bc they have no bar.
Experience based on drive thru alone...  Stopped into this Jack in the Box location for breakfast as it seemed to be one of the few fast food places open 24 hours and I was heading out on a trip at 4am.  \n\nIt was my first time at a jack in the box and the guy at the intercom was extremely helpful and patient.  While the food was a cookin' he struck up conversation and said he was going to include some free things since we were visiting.  This guy and the woman packing the food really wanted to make our experience one worthy of 5 stars.  Our order was accurate and the free hashbrowns were hot and clearly not leftover food that was just sitting around.  \n\n- 1 Star for the shady characters drinking 40s in the parking lot.
Stopped in on break from work. Needed to use restroom before eating. Asked for they key, employee refused to let me use it because \"we only allow customers to use restroom.\"  Well I will not give this location my business because I was going to order and eat in, but not when they treat guests like this!
Affordable\nTasty\nAmple portion\nQuick\n+ friendly\n\nJust don't ask them to warm it up for you. I get the medium party tray like ALL the time. The dynamite roll is dynamite! Magnifico.
Soooo I work in the mall and ordered the chicken Alfredo penne. Picked it up and came back to work to eat it, and literally there were four pieces if chicken in it and barely any sauce. Would have definitely taken it back if I wasn't at work. Will check my dish before I pay the next time I pick one up, IF I do...disappointing.
This place was decent... probably won't come again. I had literally 2 pieces of broccoli in my bowl. The girl at the counter didn't really seem to enjoy anyone's company.
These guys ventured to the Gun Store parking lot so I made the trek over in order to sample some of their offerings. One thing that I like about these guys is that they were active in responding to twitter questions I had asked the night before, a show of initiative that I always appreciate. \n\nWalking up they have a small stand-alone sign that has their menu written on it. it's a small menu of only a few items; 2 burgers, their signature Sloppijo, 2 kinds of tacos and maybe one or two other things. They also offer Bluesky beverages, scones and muffins which is a nice touch considering their hours are all over the place.\n\nThere was a girl standing by the window who fielded the orders and handled the cash transactions so that the guys doing the cooking could focus. She was pleasant to interact with and happily described what was in the items. While I was waiting, she helped a guy customize his order so that he could avoid burning his palate. The prices are reasonable and the food was hot and flavorful.\n\n I brought their Sloppi Jo and the red burger home for my boyfriend and I to share. The Sloppi Jo was just that; sloppy! but very good :) it made the paper container start to go soft due to all the porky juices leaking from the red-chile drenched pork and egg. It was served with sauteed onions and a warm tortilla; the kind of food that would be delicious after a late night of sinful activities. The red burger was cooked to a nice medium rare and also had the sauteed onions with melted gooey cheese, an aioli sauce and bacon. \n\nOverall, it was satisfying, tasty food reasonably priced. If I'm ever in their neighborhood or they in mine, I'll be sure to stop by again!
Food always tastes great and I love that they put coupons out. Plus, the staff are always friendly and kind. The only thing that could be better would be using organic ingredients.
We went to Cajun Crawfish a couple of days ago.  Although the place was empty, we were surprised by the food.  We ordered butter and garlic shrimp, snow crab and oysters with sweet potato fries.  They were all very good.  Ginormous doesn't begin to describe the size of the shrimp.   We would go back to this place the next time we're in Vegas.
This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants! I always get the honey seared chicken because it's just the right mixture of sweet and tangy goodness! I like to add on veggies for $0.99 more to get delicious crunchy snap peas, carrots and broccoli. A regular bowl costs about $8 with the veggies added on.\n\nI also like their chili paste, it's kind of sweet and just the right amount of spicy. They make it there in the restaurant so it's always fresh and good. It goes very well in their lettuce wraps! (Which are also amazing.) I have tried both traditional and the Thai lettuce wraps, they are equally good but I always go more for the traditional.\n\nThe only thing I would have to say is I don't like their Sweet and Sour bowls. Something is off in the recipe so it doesn't taste like what it should in my opinion. Other than that the Pei Wei locations I've been to have always been clean with polite and courteous staff happy to answer any questions I have.
We randomly stopped here for lunch and I am so happy we did!  \n\nThe jalelopeno appetizer is amazing. I had the Cotswald Burger and chip both were amazing. The Burger had great flavors. \n\nMy husband had the Portabello Stacker Burger and pasta salad. Both very good but I still prefer the Cotswald.
So I want to apologize for not posting pictures. As soon as the food came out, I was so impressed and excited to dig in. \nFirst, their small draft list consists of all local brews and it sounds like they constantly rotate out. I had the devil's britches and old meck's smoked Amber. My friend had the Mary's margarita that I tried and you can tell it's made with all fresh ingredients.\nSecond, the service was incredible! Simone read our table so well. We were there to kill some time and not in any sort of hurry. She helped us with the menu and all of her recommendations were perfect. We never felt rush and we never felt like a burden. Also, she is adorable and super sweet. Kudos for the beaming smile!\nFinally, the food. AMAZING! We started with the nachos with shaved chicken. House made salt and vinegar chips with house made pimento and super tender and smoked chicken. We took this opportunity to sample all the sauces which were great.  As we were getting full we began thinking the we two ladies would not be able to consume two entrees. Simmone to the rescue. She suggested we share a platter. We split the pulled pork platter with two sides. We had the amazing Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding, the sprouts beat the Mac and that's not a dis on the pasta. \nAll and all, we had a fantastic Saturday lunch! So glad we chose this spot with so many places in the area.
GARBAGE!  After a day of drinking and gambling I wanted a quick bite before bed and saw that White Castle was right by my hotel.  Looking forward to trying it out and all the people that rave about, its not all that or even that.  The burgers were flavorless, except the pickle and whatever onions they used that gave me severe heartburn all night and the next day.  three days later and my stomach still hates me for eating them and for almost $10 for sliders and fries, I could got a real burger.  Save your money and spend a few extra dollars somewhere else, this is just a tourist trap.
I don't particularly like this location of Primanti Bros. because it's really small and the menu is limited. With that said, Primanti's is a Pittsburgh classic! The food is cheap, fast, and good. Definitely a great place to watch any sports game or have a quick lunch. One of my favorite Primanti sandwiches is the one with lots of bacon!! It's soooooooo good. I also enjoy the BLT Tots and Terror Tots. I'm not sure if they have them at this location but I've had them at the North Versailles location.
Very disappointing ordered shrimp in basket \nShrimp must have been boiled before coated for frying very tough and coating very mushy.   Also served in tiny basket  very overpriced !  Southwest Egg Rolls over done!
Not sure if we went to this one or the other one, but let's just say it' s tiny and rustic on the inside.  We got lucky with parking.  The margs were good, not strong enough, but after 2 I was fine.  The salsa bar was very very good, I wish the containers to hold the salsa were bigger. The lighting is kind of poor, but that adds to the charm.  I had conchinita pibil quesadilla, which I really loved.  My boyfriend had a chicken mole taco and an al pastor taco, which he only liked, not loved.  We would never have found this place if it hadn't been for the locals, so we were grateful.  I would go back, my boyfriend would too, but would order something else.
I've technically been to La Santisima twice, but have only eaten here once. I'm so disappointed because I live nearby and wanted this to become one of my regular spots.\n\nTonight the restaurant had a disappointing mix-up with me. I ordered pick-up from them using yelp. I waited 15 minutes then drove the 3 minutes it takes to get there from my house. The place was packed, and there were people waiting outside as well (on a Monday night at 8pm). I tried to get someone--anyone's--attention, to no avail. The staff do not seem friendly and will ignore you and try not to make eye contact with you, even when they are just standing there. I decided to ditch the crowd and wait in my car, refreshing my order status on the yelp app; even after 25 minutes they still hadn't confirmed my order. Soon I got a call from yelp concerned that they hadn't confirmed my order. \n\nI finally mustered the courage to go back in and push through the waiting area to speak with a staff member. They gave me a dirty look but I had to ask why they hadn't confirmed my order after such a long time. They quite nonchalantly explained to me that their yelp interface doesn't work. I told them I had prepaid and they said they couldn't do anything for me refund-wise; they didn't even think to ask if I wanted to re-order the meal I had pre-ordered via yelp. They were happy to take my money but not find out how to give me the food I had paid for. All the while, the staff member was more intent on doing something with the cashier computer than giving good customer service and talking to me. \n\nPreviously, I have ordered the gandhi tacos. They were really rather pricey for some pretty basic ingredients and flavors. \n\nI hear this place has a great reputation; I am very frustrated by the terrible service offered. Also, if you know the yelp interface is broken, why not contact yelp to make sure no one pays for something that they inevitably will not receive? Thankfully, yelp is issuing me a refund (unfortunately I have to wait a couple days for processing). La Santisima did not own up to its mistake and made no apologies. Very unprofessional and very frustrating.
This place is simply the best. This is my favorite Mexican food in Phoenix. I have sent MANY people here and every single person has been amazed. I moved to Seattle and boy do I miss this place. The service, atmosphere, and most importantly the food is GREAT. It is all fresh and I don't know who is back there making this heavenly food but they definitely know what they are doing! \n\nThe salsa bar is huge and all of them are amazing. I can't wait to visit Phoenix so I can go again. They used to be call La Condessa.. not sure why the changed their name but who cares as long as they still have those amazing tacos, amazing burritos and that amazing salsa bar.  \n\nSide note: I am a vegetarian and have had no problem with the selection of vegetarian food. Definitely worth it.
Gr8 breakfast menu and delicious coffee cake. Creative egg dishes, Mexican breakfast and tasty pancakes.  Service is good, generous servings, and roomy tables and booths. Fresh squeezed orange juice and a variety of fresh fruit.  Lots of sides and gr8 coffee.
All I can say is SALSA BAR. I love this place. A little bit expensive for a taco place, but I'm not complaining. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants fresh authentic tacos
Came in on a Friday 5-ish for an early dinner with my friends. The place is cute, few tables, it's got a bar and 2 bathrooms. Salsa bar was awesome! There's tons to choose from.. My favorite was the salsa picante, jicama and the cilantro.. Ahhh soo good. I got the fried fish taco plate, the shark taco on the side and I also tried their horchata! The tacos were great! I love the rice it's got flavor to it and the horchata was very delicious! It's got fruit, cinnamon and nuts on top. Ok, so I didn't know it was big! I think the cup was 32oz, it's good for 2-3 people!!! The down side was the service..I don't know if the lady was stressed out because there's a lot of people and there's only 2 of them serving.. But they need to add more server/waiter during peak hours.. The guy was doing 3 jobs, at the bar, cashier and serving as well. I feel bad for them. We were waiting for our food for a long time, probably 30-40mins. When we got out of the restaurant, there was a lot of people waiting.. I will definitely come back again, just not peak hours.
Yum !! The Mayan burritos are amazing ! Slow roasted seasoned pork in a delicious flour tortilla. So good. I ordered them to go so I don't have an opinion on the service this time. Go get one !!
Having heard from a co-worker originally from Pittsburgh to try PB and the fact that I am a french fry fanatic (see \"Last Meal on Earth\" on profile), I had to make a this a first priority when visiting Pittsburgh for my business trip.  \n\nThe friend that I was meeting for dinner had no objections to eating at PB.  This location is a no frills sports bar - plasma screen TVs on the wall, beers on tap, crinkly paper menus, and seat your own self kind of place.  I ordered the Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak sandwich ($5.99 and #2 bestseller).  It consisted of a thin burger patty, cheese, coleslaw, tomato, a thick layer of french fries all in between 2 big slices of soft french bread.  \n\nThe sandwich came out on just the wrapper - no plates.  I was unsure of how to eat this sandwich that was considerably bigger than my mouth but I finished both halves in one sitting.  My friend was quite impressed by my gluttony especially for a petite person.  I highly recommend this sandwich for the portion, taste, and price.  \n\nMy friend ordered and swears by the Ragin Cajun chicken breast sandwich.  According to him, it's not too spicy.  He also ordered a beer from the tap served in the biggest beer glasses I've ever seen.  If you're visiting Pittsburgh, I would suggest that you too, make PB a priority.
Went to primantis while getting ready to enjoy the football fame the next day. We walked in and had no clue what to do or what to get. A gentleman yelled at us saying two seats at the bar. Thanked him and sat down. We sat long enough to take pictures. Ordered  two beers came back ordered our sandwiches. Yummy! Nice people behind the counter...
Ok yelp said go and happily off I went. Missed my chicken fried steak so tried this place. Close, good price, super service all win win in Vegas. Def can recommend.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm
My cousin in Vegas has taken me here a couple times when I was in town and the Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs is da bomb.  Super tasty breakfast dishes here.  Check it out the next time you're in the area.
We are visiting from Cali and we came here with a party of 8 on a busy Saturday morning. They said there would be a 20 min wait. But we were seated in 10 mins. Within 5 mins had our drinks and our orders were taken. \n\nI am a omelet conisour so I ordered a \"Wolf\" omelet. It was incredible, oh and instead of toast I ordered the crumb cake. And it was amazing. We all ordered different things and it was all excellent!! \n\nSo the bottom line is, the food is awesome, the service is top notch and the prices were very reasonable. In my book, this place is worth 5 STARS!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry to rate this restaurant so poorly, because they are nice people and they try hard. But it just didn't work for me.\n\nThe tapas concept is great, and we were gently and friendly-like advised of how it worked as we were handed menus. As other reviewers have commented, though, in practise, the dishes come out staggered with long gaps between them and if someone has their heart set on an entree, then sharing isn't always going to happen.\n\nThat's what happened with me and my friend. She wanted the Scallops [painfully overpriced at $16 for two, on much-too-al-dente pasta] and I wanted the Trout. There was a 10 minute gap between our dishes, which made for awkward dining. As for my trout (hay-smoked), it was nice, but just nice. The accompanying pea shoots were cooked into boiled-spinach-like oblivion and the potatoes were fine, but nothing special. The dashi broth offered nothing to enhance the dish, disappointingly.\n\nThe liver pate was the smoothest I'd ever eaten, with seasoning like BBQ Chinese pork (5 spice)? Pleasant, but not swoon worthy. The beet-based salad was lovely. Probably the best thing I had that night.\n\nPerhaps my expectations were too high, but I had been told this place was a gem and expected unique flavours that just weren't delivered. Everything was okay, but just okay. And this restaurant cost too much for a modest meal for two ($70, with two glasses of port) for it to be just okay.\n\nAlso, a nitpick: if you're going to have a very dimly lit restaurant, choose a bolder typeface for your menu. It was very hard to read the superfine typeface they'd used.
I can't say anything bad about Duckworths!! Their beer selection is off the charts. And their food is great. Haven't tried anything I haven't liked. Service has always been great as well. 5 stars all around!
The donuts and coffee are always exceptional. The breakfast is great too. I have been here multiple times, the service and food are consistently awesome. Definitely worth a try!!
5 stars for quality and service! Not a fancy 5 star place. But just good and reliable. Excellent breakfast sandwiches made to order.  Fresh coffee, usually 4-6 different blends. And awesome donuts, with an eclectic variety of flavors.\n\nThey also do breakfast all day. Great prices and good food, what more can you ask for?\n\nThey don't often have cake donuts. But if you request them they can be ordered I think.\n\nWhy go to the convenience stores, when this little gem is right down the street. Only downside for me, they aren't open on Mondays.
Best bar at the lake!!! Great beer, great food!!!! Bar tenders are the best!! Get the mamoo wings.
Consistently good food and PLENTY of tv's!!! One of my favorite local restaurants...
Food is pretty good for bar food, but nothing that I have sampled is stellar. They also have an impressive beer selection.\n\nLots and lots of tv's as one would expect so if you're looking to see an obscure game, they should be able to accommodate you.\n\nWe have pretty much ruled this place out because of the noise level. I know, I know, it's a sports bar. But this is my review, so I think it's a fair comment. I like to converse with my wife during dinner and I find hearing very difficult at Duckworth's.
Chicken Mole tacos are so delicious. Great art, not too busy on Saturday evening, small place... Every good Mexican place has great salsa and beans...and they bring you chips...they are doin it right.
Well this place is stinkin delicious.  The service is a bit slow, and the restaurant is not that big, so expect a crowd- but the fresh food definitely makes up for anything the former was lacking.  We enjoyed the specialty burrito with steak, and it was mouth wateringly good!  The salsa bar is a nice touch, and everything tastes really fresh and well made.  I'll be sure to stop again when I'm in the area!
Awesome salsa bar and SHARK tacos!! You rarely see the words \"gourmet\" and \"taco\" in the same sentence, but La Condesa somehow makes it work. However, La Condesa isn't in the best part of town, and I'm glad we came here for lunch versus dinner. We tried:\n\n-Different Salsas from Salsa Bar (Pecan Salsa, Pico de Gallo, Mexican Salsa, Sesame Salsa, Cilantro Salsa, Grilled Peppers, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-condesa-gourmet-taco-shop-phoenix-2?select=ytgVAxv6hFuPzqsPxwQmhg#ytgVAxv6hFuPzqsPxwQmhg): I liked the Pecan and Sesame salsas although I didn't get much pecan taste. The cilantro was too watery, but the grilled peppers were really good (and had a nice spicy kick). The pico de gallo was solid, as was the mexican salsa. Their tortilla chips are really good, and thin and crispy, so make sure you try them!\n-Tacos (From L to R: Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, Carnitas Street Taco, Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-condesa-gourmet-taco-shop-phoenix-2?select=ytgVAxv6hFuPzqsPxwQmhg#Wah_j9kHBXGf2NluqFZB_g): \n-Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco (Roasted Pork Shoulder w/Achiote Rojo, Wrapped in Banana Leaves, Slow-Cooked Until Fork Tender and Topped w/Lime Marinated Onions & Salsa Habanera Maya): I ordered this since a lot of other people seemed to like it, and it was a \"Yucatan specialty\". However, it was just ok. The pork was a little dry, and the flavors didn't stand out. I wouldn't order this again.\n-Carnitas Street Taco: Pretty good! The carnitas were very flavorful, and I liked how bite sized this taco was. \n-Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco (Corn Tortilla Stuffed w/Beer Battered Dogfish Shark): DELICIOUS! I've had shark meat before and am used to it being tougher and firmer than regular fish. However, there wasn't a big different in the texture, but there seemed to be more of a sweetness to it. I guess I enjoyed the \"Baja Sur specialty\" vs. the Yucatan. This is a must order if you go to La Condesa!\n\nI only saw a small strip of parking available in front of the restaurant, but it is shared with a convenience store. I think street parking was also available, but I'd recommend making sure you don't have any valuables out! I definitely plan on coming back to La Condesa and trying their other seafood tacos, but will make sure it's during lunch. Dining in is the way to go so that you can sample all of the different salsas. The staff was nice, but weren't the quickiest.
Just really good salsa's and Tacos!!  Just had a late lunch with the wife...had the fish tacos plate and the pork tacos plate accompanied by housemade horchata...both tacos were really good...especially liked the salsa to accompany the pork tacos.  The beans and rice were good. The horchata had fresh strawberries and nuts in it, tasted like they had  just made it!   Salsa bar has a really good selection..especially like the avacado and the tomato chipotle.  Will be back for more and try their queso's or a burrito.
I'll echo the sentiments of other reviewers that the service here is horrendous; staff is completely rude and aloof. \nPhoenix has tons of great mexican joints, no need to frequent this one. Overlook the hype and take your business to a resturaunt that actually appreciates your business.
I'm visiting from San Diego where we have the best Mexican food . The menu , I didn't really get so I ordered the soup which was great ! A little bit of direction on where to order would be good . The line was long the people in front of me didn't know where to order, they just passed me a menu . I stood in line hoping that that was what I was supposed to be doing . My star rating is for the salsa bar , I'm very impressed. It's hard to find places that offer a hot salsa
Finding someone who can make better mole than I can deserves 4 stars.  My absolute favorite is the chicken mole burrito.  The chickens mole burrito is just that- loaded with lots of shredded chicken, minimal rice in a flour tortilla.  The burros are gigantic and the drinks are gigantic.  I cannot comment on any other items as I am extremely satisfied with the mole and don't venture far from it.  I think you can order chicken mole tacos but I am unsure.  The salsa bar is tasty, too.  \n\nApparently there is a Happy Hour on weekdays.  I noticed Tequila behind the bar but didn't see any beer and am unaware of what the Happy Hour entails.
Driving down the rough streets of north phoenix, I have never really taken the time to look at the many restaurants that adorn the streets. I thought north phoenix was really only pawn shops, tire shops, and smoke shops, but my gf had heard of this place so we made a special journey out to La Condesa. After checking to make sure our doors were locked 4 times, we entered this \"gourmet\" taco shop...and boom all my misconceptions were erased.\n\nThis place is extremely clean and friendly. The tacos I ordered were overflowing with flavor and ingredients. I was thoroughly filled after two tacos.  I had the Shrimp tacos - not the cabo ones, i think they were simply grilled and guess what? that's right, no diarrhea afterwards. Also had the the sonoran carne asada tacos....which were arrachera steak marinated with fresh garlic & olive oil, charbroiled with mesquite charcoal. The tacos were amazing and the salsa bar was mind blowing. The yhave about 12 salsas to try from and I had to try them all. My personal favorites were the cilantro, chipotle and the surprisingly  yummy peanut salsa.\n\nI REALLY wanted the horchata, but they had just run out..i won't ding them for running out because we did come in 5 minutes before closing. Can't wait to go back here, you gotta give this place a try.
We ate there for the first time this weekend- service was good, if a little slower- OK, they don't have a lot of staff.  Now you know.  Our server , though, was very good, and offered some recommendations to us first-timers.  Our drinks were good, reasonably priced at about $4.25 for call mixers.  I can live with that...\n\nI had the Maffe with chicken, and while there was quite a bit of sauce, I thought it was a plus, since the rice soaked up the leftovers overnight and it was sooo yummy this morning!  The owner did make the rounds of the tables and seemed to really care what people thought of the food and the restaurant overall.
Affordable prices and quality food. We ordered the best of both worlds with fries, a Chicago style dog ( on a poppy seed bun ) and a small italian beef sandwich dipped. \n\nFries - okay. Could use more of something (salt, malt vinegar, ketchup)\n\nChicago dog - good dog and the toppings are like a mountain of deliciousness\n\nItalian beef sandwich - only 3 inches yet flavorful and packed with beef! We got them dipped in the au jus which kept the sandwich warm and added a savory taste\n\nWorth a trip out here.
Awesome place! I stopped in here right after I shipped out some wine because the only place that can ship wine in Vegas is conveniently located right next door, and I'm glad I did. I ordered the #7 double with fries, and it was amazing. The owners were very friendly as well. They checked on me several times, and made you feel valued. \n\nI'll be paying them another visit.
Windy City is rated amongst my top three hot dog joints in Vegas. This is a very prestigious honor since I'm a hot dog connoisseur. Their Vienna dogs have just the right amount of snap. They don't seem to be big fans of ketchup (I think it's a Chicago thing), but it's available upon request. Their fries are legit too. The staff treats you like family, and they offer daily specials at a good price point.
Amazing service, amazing food and ambiance.\nThis is a great place for a date.  My date was not into sushi before but definitely likes it now.\nWe shared the mushroom beef rolls and the shrimp for appetizers. And then we shared the volcano roll which was my favourite and another roll whose name I forgot. But it was all amazing.
My boyfriend and I first tried Papago's Orange Blossom Ale at Chicago's Old Pizza and thought- Hey this is the best damn beer we've ever had let's go visit their brewery since it's close! \n\nI'm simple so give me good food, beer, service, and music and I'm pretty happy. I like all their beers. My favorites were the Orange Blossom of course but also the Irish Cream one (the name escapes me at the moment) and the Coconut Joe. I really like the fact that they had alot of smaller breweries and crap beer like bud and coors wasn't on the beer list. Plus, they had pick your own six pack which is pretty damn awesome. Service was good- wasn't exceptional but it wasn't bad. We got our food, drinks and check within a good time frame and she was happy enough. \n\nI saw other reviews complaining about servers sitting back and talking and complaining and I didn't see any of that. My boyfriend and I both got the hot italian sandwich which was delicious- no complaints at all. The cole slaw it came with was okay- once again not great but enjoyable. \n\nI did enjoy the interior and how it was really laid back. \n\nPros: Delicious beer choices, good food as far as I tried \n\nCons: Bathroom was kind of \"gas station-esque\"  and while the food I tried was good there was a dreadfully small food menu
On a recent visit to Scottsdale my wife and I stumbled upon this place. I must say it is an awesome little gem! The selection of beers on tap was great. The Thai chicken pizza was super tasty. We ordered a personal sized pizza and it was huge. I live in the craft beer mecca of San Diego and this place is as good as many of my favorite spots around town.\n\nMy only wish is that they had some of their Irish coffee stout available in bottles so I could have taken some home with me on the plane.
About the only pock i can punch into Papago's reputation is their pizza.  While its not really that bad, I expected MUCH better from a place that delights the senses in every way.\n\nTheir Orange Blossom Hefe is mental.  I'm not even a very big fan of Hefe, but this stuff is on point. They also consistently have a Porter, which is my favorite.\n\nThen you can pull one of their bottled beer outta their fridge, take it up to the counter to have them pop the cap, and have at it.  Its a killer concept when you can't wait for the waitress to give you the go on a Lost Coast, or whatever.\n\nAlso, they have Beamish on tap, which maybe one or two other places in Arizona have on tap.  Certainly not places that should have it *cough*SeamusandRula*clearsthroat*\n\nSometimes if find bar decor really hokey, and though they play up their Belgian theme, it really looks great here.  With their giant monk overlooking his abbey and the aged picnic tables as gathering spots, the feeling is that you are in a tavern in Liege and not the world's snootiest suburb.\n\nI might also add that their tent at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival is the dominant one of the lot.
I'm going to go out on a limb, and say that this is the BEST spot in Phoenix to grab a beer.  As a beer lover, there is no other establishment that I have found that has the selection and knowledge of Papago Brewing Co.\n\nSo the food sucks, there is no patio, and the restaurant is sub par.  The beer is great.  They aren't trying to be anything besides the spot to grab whatever beer you possibly desire.  Cruise the Circle-K style cases for a fresh bottle, or order up one of their ever changing drafts.  The biggest advice I can give for the Papago Brew Co is to talk to their staff.  Tell them what you like, what you don't like and have them make a selection.  There are very few people that I have met that are more in tuned with beer.\n\nEnjoy this establishment, but don't expect anything more than what it is.  If you go in expecting to drink a few beers, you will enjoy, but if you go in expecting anything more than that, forget it and go somewhere else.
Prices are low (they increased from the posted menu) but the portions reflect that. Service was great but the place is literally a shoebox. The beer is kind of a rip-off. \n\nI suggest getting takeout to the nearby park Jeanne-Mance and eat there on a sunny day.
No fried food, no ranch, no business being a bar. The beer selection is great I can't lie there, but if the latex clad goth oddballs who wander in  don't put you off and bitter snarky waitresses who couldn't tell an ipa from a hole in the wall isn't a big deal to u then proceed with caution. BTW if the half lit sign outside hanging over the door proudly proclaiming \"----go\" buzzing like a bug zapper doesn't convince you to turn and run then well...you'll deserve what comes next ;)
So I wrote a review for Papago Brewing way back in the day when I was still new to this whole Yelp thing... so now that I'm a bit more seasoned, I'd like to write an update!\n\nI originally gave Papago 5 stars, and I still don't have a bad word to say about it! This has been my go to bar, my \"Cheers\", since I first moved to Phoenix two years ago. I've made a lot of friends here (customers AND employees), and I've consumed MANY amazing beers here! I can always count on them having several new craft beers on tap every time I show up, and the staff is very well educated on each of them. Zach, Jess, Matt, Mark, and Sean take great pride in the fact that they are beer nerds (like my wife and I), and always have great suggestions when I can't make up my mind! With 26-30 beers on tap, and several coolers full of different bottled beer from all over the world, it's never hard to find something I'll love!\nThe pizza here is some of my favorite in the valley! We always order the White Pizza, but you have to try the Buffalo Chicken Pizza or the T-Rex! You can't go wrong!\nPapago recently expanded to make more room for their rapidly growing business, as the place is consistently packed almost every night of the week! The new side boasts locally handcrafted tables and benches, as well as a regulation size shuffleboard table!\nWhatever your beer-drinking needs, you'll find it here at Papago Brewing Company!
This restaurant really is the type of place where you feel at home. It's run by a wonderful couple who make the food from scratch daily. Try the lasagna if you're hungry, it's fabulous.
I came here for the 10 cent taco nights on Thursday.  Nothing special.  But what does one expect for 10 cents I guess.  In fact, I am breaking their rules by bitching about it.  Yep, there is a list of rules one must follow on taco night.  They also include a two drink minimum and leaving your table to go to the bar immediately after you're finished eating.  Maybe I'm being a little uptight, but I like the friendly approach better.  \n\nThe 10 cent tacos: +50 cents for cheese +50 cents for sour cream +50 cents for salsa = $1.60 taco in a plain jane taco bell shell.\n\nThey have specialty tacos too.  They had an Indian Red Curry Taco, an Ahi Tuna, and a Buffalo Chicken.  The Buffalo Chicken was decent.  It had the fried shell, but was still skimpy on the toppings.  Also, it was listed as $2, but we were charged $3.50.  We pointed it out and they seemed fully aware the price was incorrect, but I don't think they would have said anything if we didn't.  All in all, our bill for 3 \"10 cent tacos\", 2 \"$2 Specialty Tacos\", and 4 draft beers was $30.  Not too shabby I guess.\n\nOK - enough complaing...\n\nI had the Brooklyn Lager on tap - it was so good!  The service was great as well.  The tacos came out quick and our server was really sweet.  They blast indie rock, which isn't for everyone, but I didn't particularly mind.  The patio is wonderful!  It's canopied in trees and has a wood burner, draped lights - the atmosphere was really cool.  I guess I would like to go back to try their regular menu, but I'll get my tacos elsewhere!
Our favorite new restaurant! Servers, Bartenders, GM, Chef are AMAZING. Have tried every item on the menu and not a complaint about any of them! Amazing Happy Hour with tons of items. The Beet Chips & Black Truffle Hummas are an absolute MUST. Nick one of the Bartenders doesn't forget what you drink! Ralph the GM goes out of his to make your experience the best it can be! Can't forget Jodi one of the servers!! Don't walk by this restaurant, walk right in and they will make you feel like you are \"home\"....We haven't missed a Friday night here since they opened.\nFabulous location for a private party, room in the back that can close off from the rest of the restaurant, service was impeccable, food was out of this world, they went over and above to make our group of 14 very comfortable as well as the birthday girl turning 80!
Ansprechendes Ambiente! Leider ist das auch das einzige positive was wir feststellen konnten. Die Kellnerinnen und Kellner waren ?u?erst unaufmerksam und teils auch unfreundlich (haben knappe 2,5 std dort verbracht und wurden nach dem Essen nicht einmal gefragt ob wir noch etwas trinken oder ein dessert wollen)Die Preise f\u00fcr das Essen sind \u00fcbertrieben da die Gerichte weder nett zubereitet noch vom Geschmack her \u00fcberzeugend waren. Die Ventilatoren an der Decke lassen sich nicht einzeln regeln, so dass es an einigen Stellen extrem zieht!\nAlles in Allem ein ?u?erst ent?uschender Abend in Joe Penas in Esslingen
So my buddy and I walked into Upper Crust Pizza and sat at the sports bar side which had TVs on the wall with all the games on- sweet! The area has a classy yet relaxed and fun atmosphere. Right when we sat down our waitress, Aliyah, came to take our order. Aliyah was very friendly, social, and just had a great attitude. The best part of Aliyah was her pulchritudinous and mesmerizing looks- almost as she was radioactive with \"bueatiful-ness-energy\" radiating from her.  Aliyah, with her ridiculously piercing good looks, recommended the Fried Mozzarella and they were delicious- something new that I've never tried. On to the main dish where we had half mushrooms and half pepperoni on our pizza. The pizza came out in about 15-20 minutes. The crust I'd rate a 4/5, the sauce 4/5, could use  a little more topping to really taste them 3.5/5, but the cheese was a 5/5 since you could definitely tell that the cheese was high quality- something most pizza places skimp out on. Overall the pizza was great! However not as great as Aliyah's supermodel good looks!
We've had slow service and not so great service before, but nothing as bad as today.  We were in the bar area for 9 minutes and nobody acknowledged us (there were 2 tables and about 6 guys drinking @ the bar) so we walked into the dining area thinking that would be better.  We waited another 8 minutes...2 waiters CLEARLY saw us and didn't say a word and had 2 small tables.  Finally we got up to leave and my husband asked one of them why the service was so bad.  His excuse was, \"we don't have a hostess today\".  What does that matter?   Then he asked to speak to a manager...guess what?   They have no manager either.  The guy never apologized or took any responsibility.  He only said, \"well I can wait on you now.\". We will never ever ever waste our money here again.  Not when there are so many other pizza and wing places nearby.
I'd eaten Falbo's since college in the '90s, but I hadn't had it in years. \"Let's give it a shot,\" I told my husband, and we got a hand-tossed pepperoni and picked it up ourselves.\n\nIt was just as I remembered. The cheese was stretchy and generous, the sauce was slightly sweet, and the pepperoni was greasy in that amazing pepperoni way. Hands down, this is STILL my favorite pizza in Madison.
We have enjoyed this pizza for years, but had our final visit this evening.  We were told our carry out order would take 25-30 minutes and instead it took an hour.  My husband went to pick up our order and was told it was with the delivery guy.  They tracked him down and he brought our order back, minus the salad which my husband wasn't aware of.  When I called to complain, the \"manager\" said, \"Oh yeah, it's sitting here if you want to get it.\"  I replied, \"This is bulls**t,\" and the manager berated me for swearing at him, told me I was being blackballed and hung up on me.  Seriously?  When I called back to request a refund for the salad, I was told they don't do refunds.  When I asked to speak to one of the owners, I was told to call back tomorrow, the manager wasn't leaving a note.  This is not our first botched order.  The last time we ordered from these geniuses, they \"couldn't find it\" and sent my husband next door for a cigar on them... That's classy!  They frequently forget toppings, but make certain to charge for them.  Time for the owners to do a little spring cleaning at their Parmenter location.  Me?  I'm going to frequent business that appreciate my business and take pride in their job and their product.  I would love to see their blackball list... this place can't get orders right, but can maintain a list of who they refuse to sell to.  Priceless!
When you are craving banh mi sandwiches this is the cart to go too Madisonian.  Fresh ingredients...love the pate, I wanted 3 yesterday could only get 1:-( By 1:30pm, he was sold out!  My only complaint, fyi  the lemonade was water down.  I'll be back for more sandwiches.  See you soon.
We stopped in here today for lunch. Definitely not the best dining experience we've ever had.\n\nFirst of all the young girl taking our order seemed very bored with her job. No enthusiasm at all.\n\nWe both ordered a burger and fries with a drink. I assumed they'd give us our drink cups at the counter. When they didn't I assumed our drink cups would be brought to us at the table. They weren't. We went back up to the counter to get our cups.\n\nThere was some smell emanating from the restroom that smelled like spoiled air freshener if there is such a thing. My girlfriend said it was almost overpowering in the restroom. It was a really sickly sweet smell. I'm not sure what it was but it didn't make the burgers taste any better.\n\nHere it is several hours later and I'm a little bit queasy. Not sure if it was the burger, but I haven't eaten anything else today. \n\nIf it comes back up I'll change my review to a 1 for now I'll stick with my 2 star review.
Went a few days ago. Service could've had been better for a place that wasn't so packed. \nWe had the papa la huancallina (always been a favorite), arroz chaufa y tallarin verde w/steak.\nSteak was a little on the salty side. To drink we had chicha morada which was bomb!\nFood was pretty good however, did not like the fact that they brought one of our plates 20 mins apart. Reason why I gave them 4 stars. I'd probably go again.
Simple store layout. Food was very good and portions were sizeable. Best cornbread I have ever had as was so moist.
The food was average but consistent. Have eaten here a few times due to limited sit down options at the airport. The service is very slow. I don't think it is the servers fault but the management. They are under staffed which creates the issue.
Honestly service was a little uncomfortable at first.. but please order the Vanilla Spiced Chai, literally heaven. If you order it around 3-4 you get it half off and it is super cheap and amazing.
I was visiting from out of town and couldn't believe my luck to find a coffee shop that has not only good coffee but almond milk! Add to this amazing find, they also had gluten free bread. I swear I died and went to heaven. I visited often while in town and found the staff friendly and helpful and loved hanging out here.
Wir sind mit 8 Mann eingefallen und wurden absolut nicht entt?uscht. Das Essen war frisch und lecker zubereitet und es wurde gleichzeitig serviert. Da kann man nicht meckern,\nDer obligatorische Ouzo rundete das Essen ab ;)\nDas Personal war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam, ein gelungener Abend.
I went here recently for lunch and it was just OK....\n\nAnyways, they have some neat little window - art things that I liked (better than the food)... pictures of those, as well as a link to their full menu, are on my blog (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/06/cafe-sausalito.html) \n\nI asked for honey for my french fries and the waitress said that they had it, but \"They use it for cooking\" so she wouldn't bring me any.\n\nMeh.
One of my new fav sushi spots on the city.  Great service also.. keep it up guys!
I enjoyed my food, but I was the only one in my party that did. Nice decor and pretty decent menu selection, but I have had far better mexican food before. I'm from So Calif, so it is hard to find good mexican when you travel, nothing tastes like home. I wouldn't return and if I was a local I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this restaurant again. Maybe my expectations are too high or their standards are too low.
Very good place for sea food in phoenix. This city has been lacking on sea food front and this place did good job with selection of menu along with quality of food and service. Though we had a waiting of 30 minutes , staff was attentive and very endearing with their attitude !! Definitely coming back for good time with friends
Why did we wait so long to go?!  We just got back from happy hour and it was amazing. Oysters on the half shell, calamari (gluten free and oh, so tasty), Dixie chicken,  lobster and wine (well drinks too) all HALF OFF! The food was very good. The lobster was not rubbery like you get at some restaurants, but was melt in your mouth good. Emma was our waitress and she explained the menu to us and was attentive but not too intrusive. Happy hour is Monday - Saturday until 7pm. The restaurant had a really cool vibe. We will  definitely be back with friends. Did I mention the selection oysters on the half shell, which are flown in fresh everyday, is to die for?...
Had lunch at B & R the other day -was not impressed.\nMy date and I ordered 2 fish sandwiches to split. They were greasy over battered and fried to a crisp. Sloppy and awkward  to eat in public.\nI would have rather enjoyed a dripping tomato sandwich eaten over my kitchen sink!\nDid I mention the prices? Too high for value received.\nThe ambiance is very pleasant and wait staff friendly. The kitchen was hardly taxed from the sparseness of the crowd, yet it was quite a long time between ordering and delivery of our food.\nWe're sticking with LGO.
What a great place to drink and eat.  Happy Hour is killer good and reasonable prices.
Me and my husband used to love going to zeppes two years ago, recently we came back into the area we lived in and decided to get our favorite pizza.. unfortunately the pizza Crust is made much more dry and buffalo chicken pizza now has tomatoes which really ruined the flavor. Also they are pretty pricey for such a bland and basic pizza. I will not be coming back.
The lunch buffet has gotten SO good here! Oh my my - a fantastic, large, and well-executed selection of vegetarian and non-veg buffet items. A thicker Tikka Masala curry (both veg and chicken) than their previous recipe. A long row of creative curries. Even Chicken Vindaloo. \n\nFull disclosure - this was probably my 14th time eating the lunch buffet here and I have never liked it as much as this trip. I actually stopped coming here because I felt there was a lack of selection and no variety (always the same buffet items). The last time I came here was in the Summer of 2013. We were driving by and hungry and a what-the-hell moment ensued. We went to Mint for the first time in almost a year.\n\nClearly lots has improved, and I am a huge fan. The Mt. Everest Indian restaurant on Sahara has a lot to live up to now (I've eaten at Mt. Everest close to 25-30 times.) Mint is my new favorite Indian lunch buffet spot in Las Vegas, no contest.
Love this place!  Found it by accident one evening while looking for a place to get some grub before a show at the Sound Academy. Went back again a couple months later before a show at The Koolhaus.\n\nThis is a true hole-in-the-wall, the food is unhealthy, but very tasty.  I had the chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce both times and a chocolate shake.  The chicken is pieces of meat rather than one whole breast; which makes it messy when you add the BBQ, but the smaller pieces allow it to have more flavor because of how much more surface area touching the grill.  The milkshakes are nice and thick, made with real ice cream, delicious.  I've had the fries, which are nice, thick steak fries, and the onion rings, which taste great.\n\nI will not get a burger, but that is only because I do not like my burgers cooked anymore than medium, and in Canada you have to get it medium-well or well.  My friend did get a burger though, and he said it was great.  He has had the Elvis milk shake (choc, peanut butter, banana) and says it is awesome.\n\nThe staff was friendly both times I've been there, no issues. I read someones complaint about the staff, but I've not come across that at Dan's. \n\nThe decor is hole-in-the-wall, it looks like the kind of place you get a greasy, unhealthy meal.  But even with the decor, I don't feel it is dirty at all. Love the use of old bucket seats from cars and the cool condiment holders.\n\nIf you're hanging out in TO and want to have a nice, greasy meal, this is a great place to go.  I will be back again for sure.
Kasai is my go to sushi place when i am in pittsburgh. The prices can't be beat. The sushi is soild-good. I have eaten at most of the sushi places in pittsburgh, and have settled on kasai as my favorite (quality, price, atmosphere). The owner is super friendly, and is often giving out free sides and such.   I believe he has a passion for cooking.
Kasai! Fantastic service,friendly ,helpful wait staff,great sushi. The owner and sushi maker was fabulous, great personality. My niece had the sushi boat featured above, what a beautiful presentation. I have been in the food industry for 35 plus and I think this restaurant is exceptional. I am sorry I did not get the server name , she was exemplary! Took Tim's advise(previous review) and went to Apis meadary and got the raspberry mead. No corkage fee. I got the steak and scallop hibachi ,wonderful! But did try some of the sushi and liked it , I may be a convert! The owner put spices fish eggs on top, oh my, yummy! Crunchy with a little wasabi kick,ever so slight. Owner also sent over spicey salmon salad , I can't think of any more great  comments to say but go and eat at Kasai great food, great prices , great atmosphere.
First time visiting Kasai tonight, hibachi was not available but I was there for sushi and BYOB. I started with the miso soup which was really flavorful and had a lot of soy pieces, maybe a few too many onions for my taste. We ordered three rolls, the Arizona, Rock and roll, and one other that had shrimp tempura with fish on top. The first two Rolls were delicious. The shrimp tempura inside the third roll was almost inedible, a very tough texture. We probably should have complained but we were enjoying ourselves and just decided to eat the fish and avocado off the top of the roll, which was tasty. No charge for BYOB is a plus! They also didn't open our wine for us so if they do start charging they may have to make a change to service or start with a very small fee. Overall a good experience and I will be back!
Went last evening with a friend.  Food was okay but not at the level of other Thai places in Squirrel Hill.  And their fan over the cooking area is inadequate so sharp and spicy fumes from the kitchen caused me to cough and my throat and eyes to burn.  Smell was strong enough to permeate my clothing, which I had to air when I got home.  \n\nAlso, it is small and, when full, quite noisy, and I was with a soft-spoken friend, so communication was difficult.  In future,I will try it for take-out only.
My friend stopped here and brought the food to my house. Could have warned her ahead of time. Once again, the food was absolutely disgusting. The Big Mac had no cheese. The fries tasted like old grease. Nasty nasty nasty! And my friend said their flurry machine was dirty and looked like it hadn't been wiped down in a month. Why is this location still open?!
Worlds slowest stinking drive thru. Wtf. Still in it. 20 minutes and counting. I should have just gone to Jack in the Box.
A big huge O.M.G. This Micky D's is soooo bad. Almost every time they screw up. It's so bad I'm starting to loathe Mcd's as a whole. There's always something wrong with my order. I've called to complain and was told come in and we will give you a meal for free and they screwed up again. The soda fountain is  infested with Mosquitos wtf???  Seriously if the owner takes the time to read this, you really need as someone has stated a huge intervention....
You would think something as simple as a large Coffee would be reasonable for a even a one star place. DONT GET YOUR HOPES UP. And please be prepared to either go around the drive thru at least twice or wait in the front for your order.
This is a family owned restaurant. I was the only one in the restaurant when first came in at lunch time. Was debating if I make the right choice. However, after having their sweet tea, it was flavorful so that my confident risen. Then, the 3 chefs started to take their wok and cooked my food right in front of my eyes. WOW, fresh cook fried rice? I was impressed. \n\nAfter my meal, I felt guilty because it was so cheap. $5 for lunch, includes tax. They even take credit cards!\n\nI would recommend this restaurant. Please support your local merchants.\n\nFrom the smell, I think they use peanut oil, so ask if you are allergic to peanuts.
I never eat Chicken wings at a Chinese restaurant but thay have the BEST I have ever eaten!! Super Yummy!! I also recommend the crab ragon! Great food and Prices!
This place is everything that you expect from the name, and it does not disappoint. My girlfriend and I dropped by around 2:30p after school. A couple customers were eating in the comfortable, quaint booths, and it was pretty chill. On our way in, as we were deliberating with a menu, one gentleman even said \"The food is good, you'll like it here.\"\n\nI can't really say that the food was amazing, because it was fairly standard Chinese takeout fare. That said, I couldn't have asked for it to be better without asking for it to be something completely different. I enjoyed my sesame chicken, fried rice, egg roll, and crab rangoons.\n\nI think this is a husband and wife operation, and the quality of service really sets this restaurant apart. After eating a crab rangoon and egg roll, I moved to grab my fork and clumsily dropped it on the floor. I got up and walked to the counter, and by the time I got there the gentleman was holding a fork out to me and was ready to take the dirty one back. He was both paying attention, and he cared. It would have been very easy for him to ignore me, or simply to have not been courteous. Definitely a sign of A+ service.
This is the worst Chinese restaurant that I have ever eaten at.  I went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed.  I don't write many reviews, but I didn't want someone to get suckered in like I did.  \n\nThe one good thing that I will say about this restaurant was that the food was very cheap.  However, I could not stomach but a few bites so I still did not get my money's worth.
Cafe Du Jour is a delightful, unpretentious little deli restaurant seemingly set away from the craziness of East Carson Street. I went to lunch here with a few friends on a weekday, and it was totally empty. The menu is simple, mostly soups and sandwiches, but the herb-roasted pesto chicken sandwich I had was absolutely delicious (and only $6.50!) My friend gets the baked brie, apples and raspberry honey every time she comes here, and she graciously let me have some - it was quite tasty. I can't wait for the snow to melt, because the outdoor enclosed patio in the back looks sublime.
I've been to Capriotti's twice and both times Ive had a tasty sandwich.  They have a nice selection of cold and warm sandwiches plus some signature items.  The key to any good sandwich however is the bread and lets just say Capriotti's is no Subway....and that's a good thing.   You have a choice of small or large but to be honest I thought the small was pretty darn big, so if you order a large it better be for 2 people or because you just helped a friend move into his third floor apartment without an elevator.  \n\nThe first time I went in there, I grabbed a Capicola sandwich which is always one of my favorite.  They were generous with the meat and the veggies that accompanie it were fresh.   The second time decided to throw caution into the wind and I got one of their signature sandwiches, The Capistrammi.  Talk about a heart attack in wrapping!  Thats not to say it wasn't good, because it was delicious but considering it was stacked with warm, buttery pastrami, coleslaw, mayo and russian dressing, you better not be on Cholesterol meds when you try it!  Next time I go there I want to try their other famous signature sandwich, the Bobby.  It looks like a  full thanksgiving meal in sandwich form.  I should start clearing room in my stomach now and I'll probably be ready for it sometime early next month!\n\nPrices are a tad on the higher side, but nothing outrageous.  You're getting  a higher quality sandwich than at a lot of other joints, so its totally reasonable.  This particular location is at the Red Rock Casino but it still has the same full menu as you would find at any of their other locations.  \n\nGreat spot to grab a bite before the movies right next door...unless its a movie you really want to see because you might lapse into a food coma!
Had the chicken souvlaki wrap with a Greek salad. After eating the first half and into my first bite of the second half I saw that piece of chicken was not fully cooked. Not pink, red. I showed my server and asked her to show her chef. She offered to make another half or get me something else to eat, but I couldn't wait. \n\nWe received our bill with no discount or comp. I asked the waitress for a discount or to comp my meal, she went back to her manager. He gave me $3.25 off my $40 bill. \n\nNo apology, risk of FOOD POISONING and I left hungry. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS POORLY MANAGED RESTAURANT.
SO SO SO Good. I often find myself thinking about their flour-less choc cake desert.
What a hidden gem in the South Side! Wonderful back patio area makes you feel like you've been whisked off to Italy. The eggplant rolls were beyond amazing. Sweet, personal service. Note: Cash only and BYOB.
I just had a wonderful dinner here last night with some old dear friends. I used to come here twice a year but have not been for a couple of years. I'm reminded that this is one of the best kept secrets in Pittsburgh. It's as close to getting a little bit of Europe's small proprietor owned/run bistros charm/flavor in Pittsburgh. Bring your favorite wine and enjoy a wonderful evening.
I've have been here before small and quiet place, I noticed that the service was quite slow. This time around I ordered my drink to go, service was quicker than the last time but unfortunately the tapioca was undercooked. The tapioca is what I look forward to so needless to say I was quite disappointed with my drink.
I was in pittsburgh for a week and thinking like true pittsburghers we thought we'd come here for a late night snack and what a snack it was definately a tasty sandwich different from what i've had .  the place itself wasn't much it kind of looked like an old bar but that's ok anyway it was pretty cheap you should go I could go for a sandwich right now actually yum!
When I told people I was going to Pittsburgh, everyone recommended Primanti Bros. I went and was underwhelmed. It was a big sandwich, but the flavour was not amazing. I also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me. As a Chicago native, I feel it's the equivalent of people recommending Giordano's or Portillo's. They're not exactly the greatest places in town, but they're well-known and popular for one reason or another. Do it just to say you did.\n\nI don't like coleslaw.
Yum!!! definitely one of my favorite places to grab a quick lunch. Super close to UNLV and the strip, very accessible. They usually have a lunch buffet which is a great price and if you are a UNLV student you'll get like a 10% discount as well. The food is delicious and their is a large variety of items in their buffet. They of course serve naan as well, my personal favorite is the garlic naan because who doesn't love garlic?!\n\nEach time I have came they have always been super attentive and great with customer service as well. Love their bone in goat curry, paneer (actually any paneer dish!) tiki masala, and you gotta get  a lassi drink, especially if it's your first time at an indian place. Definitely a good choice if you're in the neighborhood!
Came to the drive thru placed my order which took over 4 minutes to get correctly (so I thought correctly) because he wasn't listening. Then driving all the way home over 10 minutes to find out you can't even get the order correctly. & you refuse to fix the issue you caused.  Then you bring out your \"head\" manager and continue to argue with the customer. I thought the customer was always right , especially since this was YOUR fault. You don't listen, you rush me out the drive thru. Yeah let's just say this IS THE WORST MCDONALDS.
Dirty floors after they've been mopped they didn't even move chairs because they were french fries on the floor where we were sitting tables were clean when we walked in at two in the afternoon I had to ask him to clean tables not too happy with this location in my own neighborhood!
Great food.  Great people.  The is a mainstay in my take-out regimen.  Service is fast and friendly and the food is fresh.
New space, odd communal hallway kind of connected to the coffee shop via door and garage door. Probably will add more food places\n \nThe real issue was 8 dollars for an egg sandwich, add $3 more for 2 slices of bacon. Add a Latte and $15 dollars for Breakfast! Sorry that will never happen again.
I'm bummed that the parking situation could put this place at risk - they're lovely and the service is always above and beyond....
Delicious consumables, comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices. Highly recommended for coffee, a bacon and egg breakfast panini with spicy tomato relish,  and oatmeal reason cookie ($10).
I love the fact that this is a locally owned coffee shop and not another Starbucks chain. But I have noticed that there seems to be inconsistency in the quality of drinks depending on who is making it. This would be my only suggestion!
I was so disappointed. After making our order we had to wait for 1 hour and 25 minutes. The guy was telling us food will come shortly. But it was never ending time. Also the manager was so rude. Didn't even say sorry for long waiting. I've no idea when they're gonna learn some manners.
Original and a really great experience.  Others reviewers... Dry and tasteless?  Really?   This isn't the best sandwich I've ever had but it's original and tasty.  Friendly, fast service.  This is a must visit if for no other reason than its iconic.  You won't be disappointed unless you're affected.
Came here while visiting my family,  and was told that I had to get the Pittsburgher. This sandwich did not disappoint! It was a giant sandwich with hamburger patty, LTO, coleslaw, and french fries! This location was cool because it's right downtown in market square with a cool vibe. I would have another Pittsburgher next time I'm in town.
Have you ever watched them make this sandwich?  It's a special craft for sure.  They take two pieces of white Italian bread.  Pile on your choice of meat and cheese....then the grand finale....cole slaw and fries!  Then the put both hands on the sandwich and proceed to smoosh it all down flat. All this is done with their bare hands, no gloves here, so all you sanitary peeps beware! \n\nI don't know why it's such a fantastic sammy, but trust, it is!  I think it's just the combination of delicious (and fatty) ingredients that does the job.  It's just one more food experience that makes Pittsburgh's dining unique. \n\nIf you're visiting Pittsburgh, go here?  If you're new to Pittsburgh, go here! If you just need your fill of a sandwich with more sides on it than you usually order in a regular sitting, go here!
we had wonder full time here service was great, and the food \" steak\"  it is one of the best we try we will be back again and again \nthanks guys
Had dinner here w/ a few of my buddies.\n\nOrdered the Wagyu Rib Eye.  I've been to a few high end steak houses(Maestro, Mortons, Flemings, Ruth Chris, Delmonico) and the cut I had is by far the most unique flavor I've ever tasted.  The outside had the perfect charred crisp, and the inside was perfection.  The texture was so different from other Rib Eye's I've tasted.  The inside had the consistency and texture of Sushi.  It was delicate and chewy, and would melt in your mouth.\n\nThis might be strange the way I'm reviewing the steak here, but its the only way I can describe it.  Its the best steak, in terms of texture, that I've ever had.  The sides were OK, but nothing to wow about.  I'd recommend saving $$$ by not ordering sides, and just order a larger sized cut.  Had a nice bold Cab to go along w/ the steak which only enhanced the experience even further.\n\nThe service was what you'd expect from a high end establishment.  Didn't have any problems, and the timing of the entree's were on the dot.  The decor is more contemporary and sleek, which isn't what you'd expect.  It was very nice inside, but didn't really match the food that they were serving.  Can't really explain it, just go and check it out yourself.\n\nOverall, I'd come back again.  Well worth the $.
Disclaimer:  Our reservation was coordinated through a mutual friend and GM of The Source, a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in DC.\n\nWhen we were in Vegas a month ago for the cigar convention, we had heard from a ton of people that we had to try CUT.  We got a reservation and decided to hit the bar beforehand.  The bartender was incredibly polite and had a real good time talking to him.  We tried some new shots and had some excellent Manhattans.\n\nThe GM/Host let us know our table was ready.  After being sat, and introductions, they showed us their wine list, which is on an iPad.  It was very easy to pick the Bordeaux that we wanted (2005 Chateau Gracia).  While we waited for that, we put in an order of appetizers (Maryland Blue Crab and Jumbo Shrimp Crab Cake and also Pork Bellys).  Both were excellent, but I could have eaten that crab cake all day long.\n\nOur wine was brought out exactly as it should have been.  Presented to the person who ordered it and then poured to the others from there. Myself and a friend ordered the 28 day Rib Eye, and our other friend ordered the Wagyu. For sides we had the squash dish and I think potato something.\n\nCrumbs from bread never lasted long.  Someone was always there refilling glasses or cleaning the table.  We knew a lot of people that week and many stopped by.  The staff took notice and never attempted to interfere or rush us to the next part of our meal.  A good friend from a neighboring table decided to buy us a bottle of wine, and once again the iPad menu came out.  The wine can be pricey, so I simply opted to choose a region and allow them to choose the wine.  The Waitress was accommodating and polite throughout the process informing the gentlemen we had chosen a Bordeaux.  The bottle we received was a 1999 Chateau Leoville Barton which went excellent with out meal.\n\nNeedless to say, between the Manhattans and the wine, we were all feeling a little good at this point and perhaps even a bit loud for the restaurant.  That being said, we were never asked to be quiet or leave.   Later two desserts were brought to our table that we did not order, we're still unsure if these were from the chef or from our friend who we had been at the bar with and had since returned.\n\nI have never had such a beautiful meal or wonderful service.  The gentlemen who took care of us most this night was Pasquale, when I return I will definitely request him.
Husband & I had dinner here last night and everything was perfection! We didn't have a reservation but were seated immediately, then Josh attended us with excellent service. The restaurant has beautiful dim lighting fixtures throughout the ceiling with candles on tables. Very romantic & upscale. My husband had their rib eye cooked medium and it was perfect. I had their Alaskan Halibut and it was also perfect. We shared Mac & Cheese followed by cocktails. We will definitely be returning.
This place is awesome. Sat at the bar, Nicole was our bartender/server, she was awesome!!! Food was very good, atmosphere was great!
We went for brunch for the first time.  We both had Buck & Rider Eggs Benedict.  It was excellent - just the right amount of spiciness and a perfect b\u00e9arnaise sauce.  Our waitress let the French Press coffee sit for a few minutes and it was perfect.  A couple of salty chocolate chip cookies on the way to the parking lot.  In short we loved it!
NYE perfect location.  Great food Excellent service from Valerie.  Best Alaska King Crab legs in all of Phoenix too!  Yes we WORSHIP THE CAMEL and the Tequila Sunrise.  We'll be back again soon!
First of all, we love this area! Next, the food was refreshingly good!  We ordered a nice bottle of Turnbull Cabernet Sauvignon,  assorted raw oysters with mignonette which were really, really good!!! We also ordered the lobster roll nik niks which was good as well (although flavor of the \"sauce\" overpowered the lobster flavor). For our entree we ordered Pan Fried Loup de Mers (absolutely good and refreshing) and Pan seared scallops was cooked perfectly.  Besides all these yummy food, our server Nicole B. was extremely knowledgeable and helpful!  I have already told a lot of my friends about this place! Thank you and we will be back!
There are a lot of things to like about the Flying Saucer.  Once you join the UFO club ($18) you get a beerknurd shirt and can enjoy free brunch every Sunday.  The brunch isn't anything to write home about but they also offer North Carolina draft beers for $3.50 on Sundays as well. You can't really beat brunch and a couple of local beers for under $10. \n\nOther things I like about the Saucer:\nPlenty of parking\nGreat service\nNice staff\nKids are welcome\n\nCertainly worth a trip if you're in the area.
This place makes me wish I lived closer to Charlotte! Perhaps they will put one in Lake Norman...\n\nBoth my fianc\u00e9e and I joined the UFO club. \n\nMy thoughts: if you are going to be here more than once, it is worth the $18 to join the club. Shoot, even if you will never be back, you get a cool t-shirt when you join. But, if you will be back, your goal is to try 250 different beers. You can only add 3 every time you go, so all you crazy binge drinkers are just going to need to make multiple trips like the rest of us! (I jest, but it is nice to know they discourage binge drinking) What do you get after 250 different beers? A saucer on the wall. The coolest part, you get to add a quote to your saucer. So, start planning now! The other perk of the club: you get free brunch every Sunday. It's a fairly nice spread which includes scrambled eggs, sausage links, ground beef, muffins, and tortillas to turn any or all of that into a breakfast burrito. Not at all bad for free!\n\nThe best part: The amount of beers on hand, at any given time, tops that of most other restaurants and tap rooms! You will easily accomplish 250 beers without having to settle for beer you would rather not drink.
If you are a beer snob, then this place is for you! Yes their food is wonderful, but when I walked in, that wasn't my focus. When you walk in with beer on you mind, you are greeted by plates all on the ceiling. These are no ordinary plates! These plates hold the names of all that have accomplished tasting just about every beer that has been on tap (they say 200 is when you get you saucer on the ceiling). They have craft beers that are to die for.....rare beers you won't find at very many places. I'll be back tomorrow for the 3.50 pints. Looking forward to it. I may have to get my membership so I can eventually get myself a saucer on the ceiling......CHEERS!
Best Indian food ever!!!! Been here 5 times and the food is never a disappointment. The mango lassi is great also I would've added a picture but I drank it all! Sooo good
Definitely over priced for the quality of the food. 4 people almost $200 only ordered a couple of appetizers and 4 curry dishes..
This restraunt provided a less than mediocre expereience on New Year Eve.\n\nThere were long hairs in the noodles and the desert smelt like 10days old.\n\nDonot get there and be cheated.\n\nI'm not aware of better Indian restaurant's ,but certainly this one is hopeless
Wow! This restaurant was amazing. I had the rib eye and I can't even say enough words to describe its tenderness and seasoned taste. Yum!  This January day in 2016 is one to remember. Had the side s of spinach and cauliflower which were excellent also. I'm sorry I didn't leave room for dessert but it is something you shouldn't miss!
I gave a poor review because it started with the hostess. They were less than welcoming. For a place like this and for what they charge, I don't think it's unreasonable to be greeted with AT LEAST a smile. The service was BEYOND slow. Had to ask the waiter twice for lemon and twice to refill my water. Granted I'll say his personality was great, kind of reminds me of Joe Pesci. And the \"busboy\" was a hard worker and very pleasant. My steak was barely warm, the middle wasn't even room temperature. Overall, less than impressed for what we paid.
$$$$$$$$$$\nSeriously any place with my initials as the title is definitely going to get five stars, hands down no questions asked. I mean, who cares about the wagyu steak or the exceptional customer service or the mouthwatering filet mignon, its all about the restaurant's name. Definitely. Definitely not the fact that you get every dollar of the several hundred you are likely to spend here paid back in customer service. And if u cant get an open table reservation, call them, they managed to squeeze us in at a respectable dinnertime when open table told us there was absolutely no availability at all that day...and when I got there, I was wearing a sleeveless dress and they told me they adjusted the thermostat so I wouldnt get cold! Amazing. \n\nThanks for making my four year anniversary with my baby a delcious & wonderful one!
i went here the past friday. . .my second time being at this location.\nI love everything about it.  The atmosphere, the service and of course the food.  I'm not a really big red meat eater. . .but they have excellent mac and cheese, and sauteed mushrooms.  The porkchops were seasoned to perfection.  My fave appetizer is the marrow.  \nIt was me and 3 other gfs celebrating one of my gf's bdays.  \nI loved how attentive the servers were.  Our glasses were always full.
Came here to meet up with friends. We just wanted to eat, drink and catch up. Sorry to say I don't know our servers name, but he knew we were there to talk and enjoy  the company.  We ordered round after round of appetizers over a three hour period and he was great.  The oysters were so good, we ending up getting three dozen by the end of the night. Most places like to turn tables quickly, but they were patient and courteous with us. We asked for tortilla chips for the dip because one of our group could not eat the flour chips, which have a great spice sprinkle, with the amazing crab dip, and their response was immediate.  The shrimp ceviche was fresh and flavorful. Mussels had a fantastic broth. Thank you for an amazing night.
Stopped in tonight at my local spot. It is Saturday. There was a full bar and only one bartender on shift. I never had to ask for a drink and neither did anyone else, Brooke is a rockstar ... 21 people at the bar and a full lounge . All Pistons firing ! Great food and even better service !
The wife and I have lived in this area for 2 years and never gave this place a chance.  Now we really wish we have come here before now.  There is a nice bar and the dining area is separate enough to really enjoy either side of the house.  I would not hesitate to bring my kid here.  I had the shrimp po boy and the wife had steamed crab and fried shrimp.  All of our food was very good and the service was great.  Good key lime pie too.
This was my first time here and I will be back very clean and my food was out quickly I would recommend this to anyone who looking for a cheap and good food...
Meh. Maybe 2.5 stars.\n\nI went there because I wanted some Chinese Food and was far too hungry to take the time to journey to E30th.  The food is not terribly authentic or interesting-- just run of the mill Americanized Chinese suffering from an overabundance of \"brown sauce\".  \n\nTHE FOOD:  The veggies, chicken and shrimp are of good quality and fresh.  I enjoyed my \"cupid's arrow\" special of shrimp and chicken with green beans in a spicy sauce.  The spicy sauce was the standard brown sauce seasoned with peppers.  My daughter's noodles were a giant undifferentiated lump of congealed starch, dyed brown with soy sauce.  Inedible!  The potstickers were a touch greasy.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:  I really miss the 1980s.  So do they, apparently.\n\nTHE SERVICE:  The one stand out is the service.  Friendly, fast and pleasant.  Our waitress was so nice and helpful.  She even gave my daughter a tutorial on chopsitcks!\n\nI'll stick to my favorite takeaway when I'm too lazy to journey East.
I like this place. The bread is amazing, service is OK, and I wish they would Bring back the ribbon fries  I loved them
This is a perfect after hours place; we stopped in here a couple of times after Osheaga and it hit the spot perfectly.  It's an easy walk from the Metro green line and is also close to the hotels in the vicinity of the Musee des Beaux Arts (ie. the Hyatt).\n\nWe tried a variety of dishes, all of which were on par or excellent.  I was surprised to be able to order Beijing (Peking) duck at 11:30pm but we were, and when they brought the whole duck to show to us before they prepared the dishes, there was a noticeable hush in the restaurant.  We noticed quite a few ducks getting sold after that.\n\nOther dishes that were especially well done were the salt and pepper squid, and the spicy peanut butter dumplings, which they do with oyster sauce.  They also have a surprisingly large and diverse menu, with a large-ish vegetarian selection.\n\nThe atmosphere is on par with most Chinese restaurants.  The restaurant is particularly busy late at night but there is a fair amount of turnover so we didn't have to wait too long either night.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the place has the air of a family-run business.\n\nOne can undoubtedly find more pretentious, and more expensive, Chinese restaurants (say, in Vancouver), but Beijing delivers very well on standard Cantonese fare.
My twin sister and I headed to Vegas for the weekend to celebrate our birthday.  Knowing we had limited time in the city, we did our best to plan for a dinner near our hotel (the Tropicana) and near where our show was (Planet Hollywood).  However, after much searching, we couldn't find anything that in that south part of the strip we'd risk that much money on a dinner for.\n\nIt was Saturday night over a hot and busy Vegas weekend, and it was getting pretty late before we had to decide on something.  So, we pulled out our smartphones -- one of us on OpenTable and the other on Yelp.  We agreed on Postrio and drove over.\n\nWe could not have been happier.  We were promptly seated in their \"outdoor patio\" area, and our waiter was quick with everything.  We had ordered the calamari, the herb pappardelle, and the prime rib eye.  Atypically, we skipped on any alcohol, but since we were already drinking for free the whole day out playing in the casinos, we thought we'd save some money on the alcohol (we also had a couple of bottles waiting for us in the hotel).\n\nThe pasta was just what I needed -- creamy and thick, yet delicate in flavor, and everything was fresh.  But, next time, I'm ordering the prime rib eye, because that cut of meat was probably the best I've tried in a long time.  Came with potatoes and veggies.  All of the serving sizes were substantial, we came out full.\n\nNow, I recommend doing your research on a place you plan to go to, before you go, because if you don't know what something is on a menu when you get here, and you don't have the balls to ask, then you shouldn't be disappointed when you order it, you get it, and you're not happy with it.  That said, I knew that Wolfgang Puck had a great reputation, his restaurants don't typically find me anything but satisfied, and the reviews on Yelp seemed promising.  I didn't want to order anything I didn't think I knew, so we went with pasta and steak and were extremely satisfied.\n\nEasily used my $20 OpenTable gift certificate, and the restaurant also did a beautiful complimentary birthday tiramisu.  Thanks, Postrio.  We'll be baaaaack!
The food here is excellent though the menu was a bit all over the place in terms of what kind of food it was. But our service was great wished we could have had dessert. The \"outdoor\" experience was nice too. :)
I am a biryani lover.  Was trying to get good biryani in Las Vegas.  Tried couple of  Indian restaurants and none met the standards.\n\nAnd biryani from this restaurant will go to bottom line..even the rice is not upto the standards looks like they are using Chinese rice and the biryani mix is worst.
This is my favorite steak house in Vegas.  I always get the tasting of the new York sirloin, side of shishito peppers and wild mushrooms, the Mac cheese is good also.  For an app I really like the crab n shrimp cocktail.  The pretzel beard is delicious with their seasoned butter. Pricey but well worth it.  Perfect for eating solo at the bar.
We had dinner at Mint tonight and it was amazing! We had a few items:\nPotato and Pea Samosas - these were ok, a little too much seasoning for my liking. \nVindaloo (chicken thighs) - Full portion - very good with a tomato base. It was a great recommendation by the waiter\nTikka Masala (chicken) - *our favorite* - this was the best Tikka Masala we have ever had.  It was absolutely delicious.  We also had a full portion of this. \nGarlic Naan - also SO yummy! \n\nBetween all of this food, my hubby and I were stuffed. We could have even passed on the samosas and been more than full. \n\nThe staff was also very attentive, and although the restaurant was packed, we only waited about 10 minutes for a table.  \n\nOverall, thanks Yelpers for all the great reviews! It was a fantastic choice for dinner.
Always great bringing the out-of-towners here. This place never disappoints. As a local, it's always a treat watching 1st time guests try this place out. As we finished, the question around the table was, \"So, are you bringing the wife and family here when they come to town after the conference?\"\n\nI always love bringing guests to this successful establishment. Keep up the great work! The food and ambiance is always GREAT!
This is a dive among dives. Used to go there on occasion, because a friend insisted, but I never cared for it. Disgusting doesn't even begin to describe the bar, the customers, or the people that work there.  The mixed drinks are watered down and the beer is usually flat.  The customers and the people that work there all look like they live in trailer parks and are on meth.
This is one of my worst experience so far. The attitude of the servers was very unfriendly and uninviting. The portion size of starters was very small. While ordering food we weren't sure if we were under or over ordering and when we asked the server he wasn't helpful at all. The food waiting time told to us was 40-50 mins and the reason told to us was that the restaurant was very busy. The food was terrible . Malai kofta was very hard and didn't taste at all like the dish is supposed to be. Aloo tikki was buried in the sea of uncooked pea curry. Pao bhaji was smelling bad. All in all our experience of spending 2.5 hours for eating 2 course meal couldn't get worse.
What a huge disappointment!  Love Wolfgang along with the look of this restaurant and the booth we were finally seated at, but those were the highlights of the evening.\n\nI should of known it wasn't going to be that great an evening when I ordered a Heineken only to be told, we don't offer it here, and then my wife orders a martini with extra olives only to have it served without olives and told I'll be right back with the olives I need to get them for the back, and this was at 8:30 pm!  So then I decide to order a chilled tequila to go with my Stella, which replaced the Heineken, in a martini glass straight up and a patron next to me takes an interests and asks the bartender, I'll have what he's having only to have a draft beer given to him.\n\nNext we are finally seated in a HUGE booth that had a view of every seat in the room, nice, but we are only a party of two, so it was a little much, but no complaints.  After a half hour of watching every party larger than two being seating and served in the room our waiter finally got around to taking our order, and mind you our drinks are now empty, and he never asked if we wanted another round, \"just do you know what entrees you'd like?\"  Unbelievable for what's suppose to be a classy joint.\n\nFinally the food arrives, I ordered the bone-in rib-eye medium rare only to have it still mooing, no sear or seasoning on it and my wife ordered the filet mignon medium rare only to have hers served medium and dry, so after an hour and a half of this lack luster performance we decide to forget about sending things back because we only had a weekend in town and only god would have known how long it would of taken them to re-fire our dinner, but figured instead we would something to management on the way out.  My wife asked to speak to the general manager instead of me doing so because I was ready to break him in half for ignoring us for wanting to speak with him about what we had just experienced at this fine dining establishment, but that turned out to be a joke as well, he offered nothing but excuses and no apology either, but would give a free appetizer next time we came in.  Really I thought, and told him there wouldn't be a next time.\n\nThe only thing CUT was good for was cutting a  large sum of money from my wallet!
From beginning to end, our dinner at CUT was amazing. The decor and ambiance are modern, sophisticated, and classy. The service was unparalleled. Erin, the server, was helped by about 6 others and was so attentive without being pushy or intrusive. There were four of us at the table, and we each had two cocktails. The bartender is quite talented, and knew how to make our favorites as well as produce some of the more creative and refreshing drinks I've encountered. Each was truly high quality and delicious.\n\nAppetizers: We were served amuse bouches and various breads with butter - each was a fantastic mix of flavors. We ordered the burrata with prosciutto, melon and fig. Cannot remember a better, more outstanding bite of food. And the tuna tartare, aside from being the best presentation I've seen of this dish, was also fresh, buttery, and delightful.\n\nWe all ordered the grass-fed filet mignons. What a spectacular steak, expertly prepared and just lovely. The sides - spinach with garlic, roasted fingerling potatoes with bacon, and mac-and-cheese were elegant, tasty, and complemented the steaks perfectly.\n\nDessert (can't remember, however!) was also wonderfully presented and served, and a great end to our dinner.\n\nIf you are in Las Vegas and looking to have a luxurious, satisfying experience, try CUT.
I love CUT so much. I could probably end this review there, but its heavenly goodness deserves an actual descriptor.\n\nI practically, and sort of literally, live in Las Vegas and this is one of my family's go-tos for our joint favorite meal: steak.  They serve excellent quality meat and good preparation.  Sometimes I look at my own pictures and drool a little because I remember how fantastic the marbling is.  And what's more, there's a cut for everyone.  I love the Illinois corn fed rib eye because it tastes like cow, and my father loves the softer Wagyu style, among others.  We've tried most of the steaks on the menu, and I've never been disappointed before.\n\nAs if that were't enough for me, I like everything before and after the steak, too.  The pretzels are pretty much fantastic, especially with the assorted mustards (the other breads are good, too).  Heirloom tomato salad was great when it was on the menu, but there are a lot of other good choices too, like the warm asparagus that I love so much.  The sides are admittedly not CUT's strongest point, but it's not so bad and frankly, they're really not important.  If you care that much about sides, you may want to go somewhere that actually plates your steak.  Here they serve it to you as it is: solitary in its meaty glory.\n\nDessert is surprisingly strong here, too.  Last I went, we ordered a souffle, baked alaska, banana cream pie, AND a warm berry cobbler.  Everything was good.  I ate to a point of serious discomfort because I couldn't stop.  It was too good.  Admittedly the souffle was sort of standard fare for a \"good\" chocolate souffle, but everything was clearly very, very good. Very.  I would be hardpressed to pick a favorite.\n\nAll in all, if you can afford the price, go. Get a wine pairing or a cocktail. It's all good.
I've been to a lot of steakhouses, coming to vegas 4-5 times per year will do that. I have stayed on this property many times, but never made it to CUT. I have been missing out, I will be back. We came with a rather large group, I believe there were 7 of us. I had a steak the night before, so I was going to avoid steak at CUT. As soon as I saw the menu diversity and all of the great Kobe options I opted to get yet another steak. I was surprised at the quality and service of this establishment. \n\nMy only complaint were most of the sides were quite small, and not all that great, but the salad and steak were excellent. I will come back.
I thought this place was delicious! We had a ton of appetizers, which honestly I can't remember specifically but it was good. As for the meat - I had ribeye wagyu, kobe, and bone in. All were great but wagyu was hands down my favorite.\n\nas for sides, we had mac n cheese and potatoes. both great.\n\nbring your wallet! This place isn't cheap, but so worth it.
The MOST AMAZING MEAL that I have ever eaten...to-date in my life.  I have traveled all over, finding the best restaurants.  I have never had a cut of meat that even half-touched the flavors and service at this restaurant.\n\nIf you're traveling to Las Vegas, do whatever you have to do to go to Cut and invest in the best quality meat.  My personal favorite -- New Zealand Wagyu beef.  No need for anything on it...it is PERFECTION!!!!
I ventured to Two Dads' Diner for brunch on a Sunday. There was no wait, but I am sure it is because of the time I went. The place inside is nothing to look at but its a simply a clean classic diner.\n\nThe menu has many options and you can go back multiply times and get something new. The food game out fast and fresh. I ordered the Garbage Can which is sausage gravy over eggs and hash browns, it was good and filling.\n\nThe service was acceptable. You can tell that it is a family owned place with many young faces running around. I got the feeling that the waitress did want to be working but as long as I am not waiting a long time for something I need and they are doing their job, I do not really care. I am not a person who buts much weight on the service.\n\nOverall this place is an amazing bargain! Four of us ate and the bill was in the low 20s. A simple diner with cheap great eats! I would recommend this place for someone looking for a fast and cheap eat.
Seriously probably one of the best restaurants in the Chandler region. Their prime rib French dip is amazing. Their service is amazing. And the atmosphere is very upscale considering their prices are very reasonable. This is one of my favorite restaurants to take out of town guests to. Everything that anyone I know has ever ordered here has been exceptional.
Love the happy hour deals. All apps are half off, which means you can have dinner for about $5. The chicken quesadilla is awesome and a huge portion. I also really like the spinach artichoke dip, fresh basil and sausage pizza and the ceviche when they have it. Check them out, you will be glad you did.
Horrific and insulting behavior is what my Friend and I experienced by that little girl who calls herself a \"waitress\" with the my  don't stink attitude. That's okay because I'm Young and Retired  YOU still HAVE to get up and go to WORK  As for the food, My steak was not Worth $30.00, it was tasteless and freezer burned. I've had better steak in the ARMY, that's how bad that tasteless Boot Leather was. This was our FIRST and LAST time here.
Discovered this place accidently when road tripping with my friends.  Been back every chance I get when I'm in the area.  I live in New Jersey but every time I go to Montreal.  This is a must stop place.  Every dish on menu is amazing.  Especially my favorite dish.  Black Bean clams
Amazing place! Impeccable service, succulent steaks! Not much more to say...the bread selection is to die for, you access the wine list via an iPad which takes a bit of getting used to if you want to back and look at the previous selections but the waiters happily direct you. I'm a huge steak fan so probably slightly biased but the whole experience was a great one!
I don't do caffeine anymore, or calories for that matter... so this is my fave place to eat yummy & healthy guilt free food!\n\nThey can make pretty much any tea you can think of- I used to love chai(but I'm off caffeine, remember?) so now I always get the vanilla rooibus tea  with soy milk & a little splenda of course.  And I love their roasted chicken salad for lunch.  Something about the way they make it- I wonder what the secret ingredient is!\n\nBest part- when you get a salad or sandwich, you can add on a large tea of coffee for just $1.\n\nWhat more can you ask for?
Galanga is a small Thai restaurant, but don't be fooled, they have bomb a** food and they can accommodate special requests ;) this place is ran by a couple, and I just noticed how they were getting orders on the phone and people were coming in and out to get their food. I guess their specialty is take-out, but this is definitely a must-try if you love Thai food!
Seriously.  This food is DELICIOUS, and omg they deliver!!!\n\nI am staying at the Worldmark by Wyndham resort on S. Las Vegas Blvd. for the week, not exactly in the main action here in LV, and didn't feel like going out or cooking in tonight.  Checked on yelp and found this restaurant is close by.  Easily located their menu online (google searched: Galanga Thai Las Vegas menu), as well as lots of other sites with positive reviews, so decided to give it a shot.\n\nWhen I called & asked if they deliver here, the (very nice) lady on the phone asked someone else & found out they do.  So I ordered one of the dinner specials--for about $13 I got:\n\nEdamame as an app\nCup of the tom kha gai (chicken coconut soup)\nChicken panang curry entree\nCoconut rice pudding for desert  \n\n(Yes, I am in a coconut mood!  Lol)\n\nAdded in a thai iced tea (they packaged the ice cubes separately!! What a thoughtful touch!!) and then the $2 deliv charge, and it was still under $20 for delivery!!  And better yet--they estimated 40 min but were here in 20.  And the delivery guy was really nice, too.\n\nI truly can't believe how delicious EVERYTHING was.  I wish this place was near my home in the SF Bay Area.  But I will be back to Vegas, and likely back to this same resort, so I will do this again. \n\nHighly recommend this place.  Check their menu--looks like they have chinese food too.
Amazing food and incredibly friendly staff. Cozy little restaurant. If I was to recommend a dish it would be the peanut curry with crispy pork and of course you must have sticky rice!
I actually work in the same building as this place which is the only fast food restaurant I buy from in the small food court. \n\nFOOD: Their food is great because of the cheap price! I don't mean the food tastes cheap either. You can get a big box of salad for $6 (tax included). Now what do they mean by salad? They mean any fresh fruits, vegetables, noodles, potatoes, tofu balls, stir fry etc. they have that day and they will pack it into your box. There's just no meat. If you want meat I would recommend getting a sandwich or their special of the day which ranges from: korean style chicken, beef, fried chicken, etc. All the food tastes decent and again you just can't beat that price. \n\nService: Not the friendliest bunch but they do have a long line of day time workers to feed. Super fast though. \n\nAll in all, I love this place and it's very affordable for the good quality food that they serve. Also they have $5 breakfast!
Disappointed! We were hankering for some beef. Deciding between brisket or burgers? Chose the former and a quick trip to Union P & C. Ordered brisket, tofu, Cole slaw, pickle and red onion some wine and beer. The pickle was the best of meal. Brisket, tofu were way too salty. We remembered the brisket from previous meals as succulent and flavorful. Instead, it was dry and overly salted and peppered. Too salty for salt loving partner, and that's a lot of salt. Adding insult to injury the slaw was surprisingly bland- the server took it off the bill. Oh well, a bad night...the restaurant game is getting more competitive in this foodie city.
The food was very good. All was clean we ate on the first level. The hosts seemed bothered by us coming in although there were only two other people in the place. She never mentioned the upstairs.\nThe waitress, while sort of pleasant, was disinterested at best. I do not like that they have the nerve to \"round\" the check; in my case up.\n\nTo make it a better experience I would respectfully suggest they re-train the hostess and waitress. They should make five people feel welcome not intrusive. Train the waitress to actually explain the menu options as if they care that you understand the options. Let me know you \"round\" don't surprise me.\n\nYes I will return they deserve a second and maybe third look. Let's get East Liberty back on track to a growth area like it once was...pre developer (destroyer) Bob Pease.
As I reflect on the BBQ we ate yesterday, I'm tempted to leave work so I can go home and eat my leftovers. And the only reason there are leftovers is because I'm on a diet. Full disclosure: this was a takeout order (took about 10-15 min).\n\nThe BBQ chicken is AMAZING. It's not served sauced, but there are a variety of side sauces if you like it that way. Personally, I thought it was so juicy and well-seasoned that it needed no sauce, although I wasn't a huge fan of the ones they had this time (the seasonal rhubarb sauce is amazing, though; can't wait for it to come back!). Possibly the best white meat chicken I've ever had the pleasure of eating.\n\nWe also ordered the mac & cheese, because I wanted to try the ribs & brisket without ordering enough food for a large family. This was a bit of a letdown. The sauce was great, the meat was great, the crispy topping was all there...but there was just too much going on--the wasabi (which I normally LOVE) was a distraction from the meaty cheesy goodness.\n\nHowever, delicious chicken + 25% student discount + eminently reasonable beer prices means I'LL BE BACK.
It was a slow Monday night, but the service was friendly, courteous and efficient. I had the steak frites, which was delicious, and my server, Corey (sorry if misspelled) suggested the perfect wine. I fell in love with the \"old fascist\" cocktail on my first visit, and the bartender (Brett?) did not disappoint. What a great evening! Thanks guys!
Where do I begin so I had the lobster and shrimp burger and that was probably the most delicious burger I've ever had in a long time definitely worth the price!! Got sweet potato fries barely finished them cuz they were so generous with the amount they give lol highly highly treccomend!!
Was walking around Vegas looking for somewhere to eat and when we saw this the burgers called our name, I had gone here before and it was good!!!.  We were quickly serviced and seated. Then we ordered, and to our surprise the burgers came out 3 maybe 5 min after ordering.  At first, since we were starving, we were happy to just have food in front of us, however that feeling was short lived.  We quickly realized the burgers got there so fast that they must have been sitting there already cooked for god knows how long.  But again since we were starving, we continued to eat.  And let me tell you what a mistake that was, I've been having stomach pain since and wasted a lot of time last night and this morning in the room rather than enjoying my trip.  Very disappointed.  Will not be returning.
WHAT?  They changed the menu this past month and took away the jalape?o poppers??? They figured out that their is an \"E\" in Burger so changed the name to Burger instead of Burgr.  They revamped their menu but some of the classics are still there like the farmhouse burger (my favorite) The sweet potato fries are still great and unchanged.  But come on, you can get a good burger anywhere on the strip.  The Jalape?o poppers truly was my big draw to this place.
Horrible customer service, I would've given it a three had the last part of my visit here not left a bad taste in my mouth. Server was ok, fairly slow, it wasn't even particularly busy when we went (10pm at night). Food was nothing special, your average sushi. I was part of a group of three and between the three of us we left an adequate tip based on the service we received. When we went to pay, we got a very snide look from the server which could've been let go, whatever... \n\nAs we went to leave we were approached by a server and their manager who demanded to know why no tip was left, accosted by a million questions - we said based on the service we received we felt what we had left was more than adequate. She then went on to say, \"Well, my servers will not get paid enough then\" To which we had to reply \"Why don't you simply pay your servers the correct wage?\" \n\nWe then said fine, whatever, we'll add on a few extra dollars. Without asking, she then proceeded to refund the INCORRECT BILL so we could pay it over again. The friend who's bill got mistakenly refunded then simply paid again, this time excluding the tip we had given previously due to his horrendous treatment. What kind of place will APPROACH YOU AND DEMAND MORE MONEY? If you expect an amazing tip, provide AMAZING service, or at the very least make great food. Neither was provided and therefore the standard amount of tip was given - which in my opinion at this point was too much.\n\nDon't go here if you expect to be treated with common decency and respect!
What a great sushi place....The portions were more than satisfying and the service was quick.\n\nThe food was very fresh and the menu w\nHad a large selection to choose from.\n\nWhen traveling out of your normal sushi range, it's always a cap shoot....I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great sushi experience.
Ate outside in the 70* partly cloudy patio area because indoors felt like it was 58* brrr \n\nTaco beef salad good as usual.\nBurger a little under cooked for medium rare but tasted good,\nChili cheese fries were good portion but the fries were a bit over cooked almost mushy. \nPumpkin pie shake...awesome! Like real pumpkin pie!
Excellent food, service was great and fast. Had lunch and chose the lunch special. 3 beef tacos were flavorful, perfect generous amount. Food came out piping hot and within 10 minutes. Chips were crispy and salsa had awesome flavor. Love this place! Lots of history here.
It was recommended to us by a promoter of the music at the Watermelon Festival (thank you Warren!!!). We had 7 people and it was right at lunch time and they still got us in very quickly. Service was a bit slow but to be expected right smack in the middle of the festival. Tamales? AMAZING    and I'm not a fan of tamales unless they're homemade. Bartender was a hoot (Lulu you're the best) as was the waitress. Will definitely be back as often as we can, being as we have a 3 hour drive to get there.
Walking 6 miles in Las Vegas in 110 degree weather may have not been such a great idea but walking to Himalayan Cuisine was. Since I didn't want to have Indian food that I could eat anywhere else, I opted to try something from Tibet or Nepal. Since their lunch specials were mostly Indian, I ordered from the menu. \n\nThe Tibetan/Nepalese section was rather sparse in comparison to the Indian section and chose one of two vegan options. I ordered the Chau Chau which was a flavorful blend of noodles and vegetables with chili paste. The dish was pretty good though I wish there was more variety than just noodles and was happy that I chose the half order which was sufficient enough to fill my stomach and left me craving for dessert. The half order was similarly priced as the lunch special. They offered one vegan dessert option which was absolutely amazing. I tried the Gajar Haluwa which is a carrot \"pudding\" that consisted of carrots chopped up very small and sweetened by its own juices mixed with raisins. Apparently nuts were also in the \"pudding\" though I didn't see any. Their red tea peach iced tea was also delicately sweetened and refreshing for the hot weather. \n\nThe atmosphere is alright. It is a lot more casual than it looks on their website. Their right wall is under construction pending a Lassi bar and they use paper napkins instead of fancy napkins. I can only hope that the Lassi bar will include some non-dairy options!
I've always had great food & drinks here.  A couple of times I've been here, our waitress seemed to forget about us and we had to flag her down.    The wine is expensive!
We started with drinks on the upstairs patio and enjoyed talking to the friendly bartender.  Dinner itself was excellent.  The table shared tartare that was a big hit.  I am not an octopus fan but my friends enjoyed the generous portion.  My avocado wrapped around Dungeness crab was a beautiful presentation but only tasted ok so I wouldn't order again.  The cod was amazing!  I loved it and we ordered each of the sides.  Mushrooms were my favorite, although the truffle mayo made the fries a very close second. All the sides were good.  The only oddball thing of the night is that I asked for the bill and handed the waitress my credit card.  When she returned she handed it back to the oldest looking man in my party.  It was a business dinner and I was the only women with 4 men so maybe it threw her for a loop but it was a little awkward.
I love it! They use the best ingredient to give the best flavour to us! Amazing! The fish you must try!!!! It really fantastic!
Food was very tasty. Everything was very rich in flavour so it's kind of good that everything was in small portions (although not good to the wallet). I had the bacon flat bread, which was kind of salty. Then the scallops with a side of broccoli. Scallops came with risotto which was very very rich. Broccoli was soooo yum! Definitely order it if your wallet can bear it. It was a little loud at first (around 8pm on a Tuesday night) so a bit hard to have a business dinner.
Without a doubt the most creatively intricate, meticulously prepared, and delicious food I have ever had! Amazing Arctic char, steak tartare, and frites. The atmosphere is great, with unique vibes in both the upstairs and downstairs dining areas. The staff is also knowledgeable and accommodating. Pricey but you have to go at least once!
Went to the chase with high hopes. Friends of ours had recommended it to us knowing we were big oyster fans. A short google search later and we were booked in for Tuesday night. The menu is short, a few classic seafood dishes as well as a few with a fusion flare. We decided to sample some of their most popular dishes, which included ceviche of scallop, tuna nachos with taro chips, oysters on the half shell and seared sea scallops and oyster po boys. All recommended by our waitress. She was helpful and friendly. Our first dish to arrive was the daily special which was scallop ceviche, which was hands down the worst fish and possibly the worst form of scallop I've ever had. It was fishy, not fresh, not appetizing and way too salty. Quite frankly, just thinking about it makes me gag. It was shocking that they had such a dish as their catch of the day. It belonged nowhere near a place that claims to serve fresh and quality seafood. I refused to eat two of our oysters because they were no longer good to eat. When we informed the waitress politely that they were not good she didn't inquire further nor did she offer to replace them with good oysters. Now I understand that sometimes when restaurants get their supplies, a few bad oysters will find there way in, however should be stopped right when the patter is being shucked and before it makes it's way to the table. Especially when your paying 4 dollars plus a shuck. The other dishes were not so memorable, small and over priced too. Overall, if your looking for great seafood, and don't mind paying a premium price for it, your better off at Rodney's where there dishes are straight forward and consistently fresh and simple. Don't waste your time and money here.
Ok - I have now been to the restaurant well over 20 times.  It is close and everyone I lunch with wants to go.  Having been there as much as I have, I now regularly get free amuse bouche and am seated in the same great spot near the window. \n\nThings have really changed here.  I eat out almost every day for business and The Chase is now my absolute favorite. Not just the perks either--the service and food are now absolutely tops.  There is no bad dish, but the Octopus, avocado roll and big eye tuna are among the best.  The service is quiet and attentive and not pretentious or overbearing.  It's now under a new general manager and I wonder if that had a hand in the change, or whether the place has simply grown up.  Either way, a great place for a swanky meal.
I ordered drunken noodles to-go and wasn't at all impressed with the quality of food I received. The dish lacked a lot of flavor and the portion size seemed quite small for a dinner portion of food. I've eaten at many other Thai restaurants, including other places in the area, ordering drunken noodles just about every place I go, and while it wasn't the absolute worst Thai food I've ever had, it definitely wasn't even close to being a contender for the best... would not recommend.
This is one of my favorite places to eat vegan food in Cleveland - the menu is large and varied, and the prices are reasonable\nfor a sandwich and side. I am obsessed with the Hula Burger! My husband also loves it and he does not exclusively eat vegan food. If they have Oreo Brownies, you best pounce on one.
Never thought I would catch myself saying this bit this place might make me go vegetarian if I lived in Cleveland. Located right downtown across from my office this week, the huge menu made me drool. \n\nStarted off with a smoothie that had protien and spinach in it. Mmmmm, talk about delicious. Then had the buffalo dip with pita and celery as an appetizer. But then wolfed down a whole salad (which was really only about 3.5 stars) but man these gals know how to make things look and taste good. \n\nI'm looking forward to going back many times over the next few weeks. Especially if I can't find any other places that have good and healthy food in this town.\n\n10/15/12\nBuffalo Chicken Dip = pretty tastey, just gotta get over the fact that it's not real chicken \nSoba noodle salad = not bad. a little bland for my taste\nBlue Flamingo Smoothie + Spinach = the bomb.com\n\nUpdate: 10/16/12\nCarrot + Banana + Spinach + Protein = why did i ever think this was a good idea?!? \nPesto Burger = Heavenly!!!! omg. best pesto ever. i feel bad for anyone near me.\n\nUpdate: 10/17/12\nAsian Rice Bowl = meh ... not bad but the brown rice was pretty dry\nGreen pepper soup of the day = pretty good for healthy food.\n\nUpdate: 10/18/12\nChicken Quesadilla = pretty good. quite cheesy. I think i'm honestly done with the fake chicken though. I miss the real deal.\n\nHas been quite the marathon so far. I've eaten here at least once everyday this week.
i got 3 street tacos. 2 of them were just meh but one of them (i think the pork one) was aaahhhh may shingggg. my boyfriend loved what he ordered as well. the salsa bar is great but it was all too spicy for me hahaha. plus the fact that the prices are so low makes this spot a must-try.
It's been almost 11 hours and darn it if I'm not still thinking about that mahimahi burrito. So fresh. So tasty with the various salsas. So awesome that it's just down the street and I can come here whenever I want and spend WAY too much time choosing the salsas I think would best compliment my meal. It just don't get much better than La Condesa, and that's coming from me, and me has a pretty serious taco/burrito issue, as in I always want them and I always want them.
Tasty food, great horchata. But, the waitresses seemed stressed out. Nonetheless, I will be back. Really enjoyed the food. Great cheat meal.
Love love love.  Favorite thing on the menu is the gaucho burro - it's so good I don't waiver from that.  The salsa bar is an obvious plus too.
Very nice jerk chicken. Absolutely love it. I have tried other places for jerk but this by far is the best of the best.
I must say that a 5 star rating does not do justice to this place. Their jerk pork is the best!! I highly recommend their food.
It's really dropped off here. I normally come in Thursday night for oysters. The last two times the food has made me sick. The little bartender has the worst customer service ever. The silver lining is the server Jose who always remembers what you like and is very attentive. They are barely even comping play now or maybe it's just this bartender. Unfortunately not sure I can come back after all this time.
Uh...YUM. My coworker brought back a ton of stuff to try from their recent opening. Everything we had was delicious, with lots of leftovers to bring home and chow down for a few more meals. The hummus and baba ganoush are silky smooth and sooo garlicky, and the tzatziki is nice and thick. The lafah tastes really fresh and handmade with pleasantly varying thickness and a great chew. We also split the sabich which was enjoyable, but I might have liked it better if I'd had it hot - still, even at room temperature the flavors of eggplant, egg and pickled veggies were excellent. The shredded brussels sprout salad seemed a little out of the realm of what I'd expect from mediterranean cuisine (not that I know exactly what to expect!) but it was good too, with big chunks of bleu cheese and walnuts. \n\nPrices seem reasonable, especially if you order a few different things and share with someone else. I'm super excited to go visit on my own and try the falafel and pretty much everything else on the menu. I can see this becoming a new favorite lunch spot for sure!
It's the newest hot spot in the South Park area!  I've had various people tell me to check this place out.  I finally did for a lunch adventure.  Luckily, I came with someone who has been here before, and we came before the lunch crowd which starts around 12pm on the weekend.  I was overwhelmed (in a good way) by all the options and choices you have.  I ended up getting a half rice and half lettuce bowl.  Then you choose from a bunch of different ingredients to add.  I tried it all and added some chicken at the end.  The bowl you get is huge, but it was so good that I ate it all.  The staff that work there are super nice and helpful too.  I highly recommend this place!
I have now been here way too much that I have perfected my BYO bowl and have come to appreciate the high quality of the spreads. I mentioned that it's the Qdoba/Chipotle/Subway/Blaze of Mediterranean food before, but it's so much more than that. It's not just veggies or cheese that they throw on top. It's stuff that they make from scratch that's good enough to eat by itself. I need to get their recipe for the green sauce because I would put that on anything and everything. The last time I came here, I was feeling especially hungry and also got their falafel balls which were amazeballs.
This place is one of a kind and everything I've ever had has been superb!  The staff and management also take time to stop by each table thank you for coming in and ask what they can improve upon.  Great food and service and we will be back!!
I've eaten dinner here three times.  Each was incredible.  The soups are awesome, the pizza appetizer was extremely flavorful and each entree has been perfectly prepared.\n\nFire is big on flavor.  There isn't much here that will disappoint.\n\nWho knew?  Apparently everyone.  The last two times I tried to eat here I couldn't get a seat.  Oh well... I'm glad high quality is being rewarded with success.
Wonderful restaurant, one of the tops on the east side. Service can be a bit slow when they get crowded, but the food usually worth the wait. Sunday brunch has a nice menu and is a local favorite.
I went in for dinner at Fire last night and loved the vegan entr\u00e9e! It's absolutely delicious.  Our server and the hostess could not have been more accommodating and pleasant.  Even our busser was cheerful!  And don't get me started about how great the Fire split is!  I can't wait to come back.
Me and my partner ate here last weekend for the first time. It was busy, the wait was 20 minutes but well worth it. The prices are reasonable and parking wasn't difficult to find. The food and atmosphere are perfect.
It's hard to find a good old fashion hamburger joint today that still has customer service, but this Whataburger is tops on that list. Every time I have either used the drive thru or gone inside to eat, the staff there has always treated me very well. There is one girl that usually works the drive thru that is the nicest person you would ever have serve you and you can tell she truly wants to make sure you have received your order correctly and even if you change your mind at the last minute, she makes sure you feel okay about it.  Oh did I mention the food there is Great too!  Love their Wataburger with lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mayo only, with an order of onion rings! Mmm Delicious!!!
Tastes like home made! I love this place, ever since I moved to Arizona about a year ago, I have gone multiple times. My favorite is the Jalapeno burger. That's if you can take spicy :) The meat is great quality and the fries are awesome!!! My mouth waters when I think of this burgers! The customer service is nice too :)
Good food but slightly over priced. We've eaten here several times for brunch and once for dinner. Brunch is 50 / 50 if the plate will be great or average. Dinner plates were all great, but I've eaten at better restaurants in Chicago that are cheaper overall.
This place is great. This is my favorite place to go for brunch. I recommend the tandoor smoked pastrami hash and get a sticky bun too.
This was my second visit to Fire Food and Drink for Brunch.  I still haven't been there for dinner.  Brunch, on this visit was just as good as the first time.  My teenage daughter and I dined here, after church and before heading to an early afternoon performance at Playhouse Square.  We had a 10:30 reservation, we arrived to a pretty full restaurant and patio.   We were seated immediately and our server approached our table in order to take our beverage order and recite the daily specials.  We ordered the sticky bun to share and I ordered the Fire Benedict and my daughter ordered the breakfast pizza.  As per the Yelp reviews, the sticky bun was AWESOME, warm, fresh and large enough to share.  The entrees arrived shortly thereafter.  The Fire Benedict consisted of a split homemade english muffin layered with ham, topped with 2 perfectly poached eggs and warm cream hollandaise sauce and accompanied by a simply dressed salad of mixed greens.   My daughter had the breakfast pizza, which consisted of a thin, slightly chewy crust, topped with 2 types of cheese, bacon and breakfast potatoes.   This was a great mid-morning meal.  I will definitely return!
I get to Phoenix a few times a year and I come straight from the airport to get the El Gaucho Quesadilla -- Argentine beef is so tender and flavorful and the crunch of the quesadilla is perfection. YUM!
Love that you can taste the soup before you try it!!   The bread and butter is amazing.  The Caesar salad is really delicious.
my wife and I always come here and split the half chicken dinner.  the portions are huge so we just split one meal.  the Piri Piri sauce is amazing.
Wow, I don't think I've ever had this much salt in my life. It's like the whole bottle was doused over the meal. Flavour is ok, if you can get over the saltiness of the food. I wouldn't recommend this place unless it's a late night snack after some heavy drinking.
Too many guys with computers. Crowds out the people wanting to eat the food. Huntersville needs more WiFi connection businesses.
Atmosphere is nice.\n\nFood is okay.\n\nA bit pricey. (Would it kill you to serve some fries with my burger? It's kind of ridiculous that I have to buy it as a separate side.)
I've been a customer for years and they have never disappointed, so I must give them a good review. Sushi and Sashimi is fresh, the same staff have been there for a while and know us as regulars which is nice. The portion sizes are good, and rarely have to wait for food to come out of the kitchen, good value for all you can eat
I can't believe I never went to this place in the two years I've lived in Plaza Midwood.  After seeing all the yummy ice cream social media posts for National Ice Cream Day, I had to get a cone myself.  Initially, I was undecided between Elizabeth creamery and Two Scoops, but after a friend's recommendation...I settled on this place.  The inside has a wall with cool trippy murals that will keep your eyes busy while waiting in line.  The seating area is not large but you do have huge picnic tables you can sit at outside.  Parking is not the best but this place is worth the walk if you have to go down the street to park. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and double chocolate in a waffle cup. What an awesome combo!  Service was good and very helpful. I do wish they had offered some suggestions on pairing but still hands down...best ice cream I've had in a few years! Two Scoops for the win!!!
We stopped here on cross-country trek. \n\nA) so much better than trying to go to all of the cheesy chains just down the road. \n\nB) 'Billy' created our entrees this evening. Here, Billy is not just a subway employee, he is a savant, a true sandwich artist. Our subs were made with meticulous attention to detail and in a timely manner. Thanks, 'Billy'.\n\nThat is not sarcasm, it was an awesome sandwich.
Poor service! They took long and aren't even as busy as In and Out. \nThe ignorant cashier with tats on her hands took my order repeated back my order several times after I clarified NO ONIONS. She kept saying everything? I had to consistently clarify NO ONIONS. She finally said ok.\n\nAfter waiting 15 mins for my order, I drive home to take a bite into a saturated burger full of uncooked white onions!\nI specifically said NO onions! I hate raw onions on burgers! \nSo call to tell her she messed up on my order. All I was asking for was for them to remake it but she insisted on arguing to justify she's right. She only heard what she wanted to hear and didn't want to admit wrong. Again all I was calling for was to have them simply fix and remake my burger. She was just wasting my time and breathe. \nClearly nothing was going to get handled over the phone.\nShe lacks good work ethics and has no understanding of customer service skills. \n\nI'm so annoyed. 10 min drive, 15 min wait, had to drive back and wait for her to refund my card. That's about 40 wasted mins of my life I'll never get back! \n\nWhy go here and pay more for their bad service and greasy I've priced burgers when Smashburger and In and Out are down the street on Tropicana and Forte Pache?
My first and last try. I think the meat is tasteless and the tomato was almost green,  Enough said!
Good food and atmosphere.  Unfortunately, we felt ignored by the staff.  We had to flag down servers for drinks and condiments.  The manager spent most the time we were there chatting with friends at the bar and watching the game.  This was not our first visit but it was our last.
Great atmosphere, food is not good. Salsa tasted like a metal can. Taco meat was awful. Guac was just ok, queso was ok but a little lumpy..this was my second visit and will be my last and it is a shame because I love sitting up on the roof:( they need an overhaul on their recipes.. Worst Mexican food I have ever had and Mexican is my favorite
Do you ever just have that craving for a delicious sandwich and a bowl of soup without all the fuss and goings-on..........this is the place.\nI've even used this for company events, catering in for my work group - everyone loves it.\nChain or not - this place is just simple goodness.........friendly staff, modern surroundings, an amazing beverage bar..........you gotta try it.
My favorite place to find a great sandwich, salad, or soup. Blows Paradise Bakery/Panera Bread out of the water. I wish they had one in the west valley, but I will keep driving to Phoenix for this one until then!
Not that impressive. Decent calzone with soft crust though. Cooking for the tastes of people with advanced ages basically.
My husband would go to this place when it was metro center. The service is still great and food delicious.
Found this place quite a few years ago I haven't been here in a while but its still very good. Hot and sour soup as great flavor and the Kung pow 2 was better than I expected!
Disclaimer: the review is about their brunch menu, although I think their Mexican menu is also very subpar. Take the extra drive and go to Mad Mex if you don't want to be disappointed. \n\nWould give 0 stars if I could--do yourself a favor and never come here for breakfast/brunch. \nSteel Cactus used to have good breakfast with fresh eggs and enormous fluffy pancakes. My visit today was extremely unpleasant. \n\nThe pancake was not only smaller, but the batter was gritty and had an off taste to it. Also they definitely made the pancakes on the same grill as the ones they cook their meat. \n\nAlso they must have thought that using powdered eggs while charging the same amount of money is okay. The scrambled \"eggs\" were cold, gritty, dry and chalky. Definitely the most disgusting thing I received today. \n\nDisappointment really, since this was a nice alternative to standing in line at other breakfast places on Walnut
One word--Yinzerita! A beer garnished margarita it does not get any better than that! I've only been to the Shadyside location, but am hoping to check out their E. Carson St. store here soon.  Now some Pittsburghers swear by Mad Mex as THE Mexican place in the town, but I prefer Steel Cactus, especially their \"build-your-own\" feature. I particularly enjoy the chorizo burrito with verde sauce--simple, fresh, straightforward, and satisfying
There is a lot of competition just from 16th street to 20th street on Camelback.  Cafe Zupas is another decent place with affordable prices.   \n\nI think the concept is similar to Paradise Bakery Cafe.  You place your order at the different counter stations, either salad, sandwich, or soup. However, they don't have a coffee station, wish they would, but do have a dessert counter.  They all looked so sweet & delicious!  A plus is while waiting in line, they give you different soups to sample.  I tried the Thai Lobster Curry soup, it sounded better than actually tasted for me.  To be safe, I stick with the clam chowder soup.  It was rich and good flavor, but loaded with more potatoes than clam meat.  \n\nAll their soups include fresh bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry.  You get to choose 2 combo for $7.99.  The sandwich came as whole not just half along with the soup.  Overall, an excellent spot to get a quick lunch/dinner.
I love this place, it's a bit of a drive from where I am but that's okay, it's worth it, and a lot closer for me than the Markham location. I've been keeping my visits a minimal since the fall though. I usually order Black Milk Tea, Royal Milk Tea, or Wintermelon Tea with foam + tapioca + coconut jelly at 50% sugar(foam is a game changer for this drink). At first the Wintermelon tea was way too sweet for my taste but my cousin kept bringing it over for us and eventually I grew to like it and ordered it every time I went. I don't really ever drink the foam the way it suggest. I just make sure I get foam along with everything each sip, everything complements eachother really well.\n\nAnyways, the line up is usually long on weekends in the evenings til closing, but it really depends on your timing, usually I'll go in, there's 1-3 people(they're usually in the same party) infront of me, not bad, then when I'm done there's a line out the door, maybe it's me they came for right? Right guys? Ha.. ha.. I love the late closing, I'm pretty lazy in the day. The staff there are extremely friendly. Don't really see many new faces when I go there. It's clean, nicely light, night decor, seatings usually full around this time as well. A lot of people hanging out with friends there. Wait times I feel have been getting shorter although as I've said, visits have been minimal since the fall. \n\nThe best entertainment(aside from the kpop if you enjoy that) there would be seeing all the cars up front getting ticketed.\n\nAnyways, the dairy from the drinks is good to accompany or sooth any spicy food you might've eaten up there.
We have never been inside this location but do call in for delivery. \n\nThis is my go-to place for wings. I am a huge, huge fan of the sweet red chili sauce on well done wings for that nice light crunch. The large sized salads are nice and full with a perfect amount of fixins'. The large here could do a good four servings. Barro's is also the go-to for my husband when it comes to the mozzarella sticks.\n\nThe pizza itself is pretty good. The slices and crust are thick and at times the cheese is just as thick, you can pull it off in a layer. My husband loves cheese so that is the idea of pizza heaven for him. I am a light cheese kind of person. The cheese ravioli (with meatballs) is also a good choice and it comes with a side of garlic bread.\n\nBarro's was the first pizza encounter I had when I moved to Arizona and to this day it is still a favorite.
With the four stars we hoped for an unforgettable authentic Mexican meal. Restaurant easy to find kinda in a run down area, oh well sometimes that's where the best food is. Our first clue should if been the house that's part of the parking area that the lights had been absolutely or electricity been turned off, the tenants were out sitting on couches and steps. The second clue should of been the music that we could hear from our parked car. On entering the establishment we saw one table occupied  the rest empty, the group of five musicians were playing so load that I never new what the waitress was saying or my group. The room was small , we ordered drinks and learned there was no hard liquor Fortunately one us had two pair of ear plugs that they inserted immediately . I chose to insert to big wars of napkins in my ears. We discussed leaving but we didn't want to be hasty. We ordered and prayed they would stop playing. Both of the orders of chimichangas were over fried and the tortilla was so thick We could not cut it . Both of the guys had enchiladas the sauce was something other than the normal one , one of the plates had to be sent back cuz it was cold. The prices were the same as a fine franchise , Chilies , El Toro, . We waited longer than necessary for our food considering we were the only table ordering. Yes the music finally stopped near the end of our meal.\nDon't go , it's a waste of your money and time we were very very disappointed. This was November 25   .
We've been going here regularly for years.  The menu rotates at least weekly but always has certain staples such as porkchops and a vegetarian dish. Every dish is fantastic and focuses on local and seasonal fare.  The owner/chef often experiments with new styles from different parts of the world and is always expanding his repertoire.  Despite how frequently we go, we never get bored of the food.\n\nOnce or twice a month they do wine dinners that are extremely affordable with a selection of good wines in the $10-$25 range that you can order and pick up a few days later.  This is where we've been getting a lot of wines lately as it keeps our rotation of new wines very high.  The best wines from these dinners often end up on the wine list, which isn't long but tends to be both affordable, well rotated, and high quality.\n\nPersonally I really like the atmosphere.  It is not a large place and sometimes can get a little smokey (much like my own kitchen) but I always feel very at home here.  We often go on Friday nights as a way to unwind from a long week and I can feel myself relaxing as I enter the door. The art is also done almost completely by the owner, who has been becoming more and more popular as an artist in the Madison area these days. It is highly abstract and very colorful.  He rotates it on a regular basis and a number of times I've seen people come in off the street because they saw the art through the window and wanted to get a better look.\n\nOverall our favorite place in Madison.
A friendly waitress with a smile gives it a second star.   It's hard to be real in a airport... But at least pretend to serve warm wood.
Zero stars.   Manager was an awful, miserable human being.  People at the bar asked if the audio to President Obama's speech could Be turned on.   She said no because apparently, the most significant presidential speech since 9/11 was \"too political\".    A few minutes later, one of te waitresses asked her to change one of the other TV's to cnn somewhere else in the restaurant because a customer requested to.  She barked back at the waitress \"no, it's on enough TVs.  Tell them to move\".  \nWhat kind of customer service is it to tell someone to pick up their entire meal and luggage to move?   \n\nI am soo glad this happened before I ordered my food.
Disgusting!! I ordered the chimichurri burger. It tasted like boiled meat. Seriously, it tasted exactly like the burgers we were forced to eat at grade school lunch cafeterias. It was that bad. Threw it away! Total waste of $12. Run away if you want edible food!!!
I'd like to be able to do 3.5 stars to balance out the overly excited tourist reviews. It's breakfast for lunch, though, and just that (and the fact we can't give half stars) earns it that extra half. It's solid, good but not amazing breakfast fare from very nice people.
My experience seems to be more disappointing thank people who came here. I ordered three cheese egg Benedict, I was very surprise to see them use kraft cheese on their food. For the price they charge, i did not expect to have that. Very disappointed
Holy hell, what a breakfast! This breakfast/lunch restaurant is quaint. White walls, two brick side walls, black accents, metal duct-work ceiling. Local artists' paintings adorning the walls - not to mention bold bright color palettes. Floor to ceiling windows make for great people watching!\n\nWe got there after the main morning rush apparently, seeing as there was only one server gentleman and two other patrons. The gentleman was very polite. Gave us time to look over the menu, which is quite full seeing as they cover two meals of the day. The place mat houses pictures and descriptions of their fresh squeezed juices and smoothies. \n\nPrep yourself, friends. These entrees are quite large! And, talk about striving for your five food groups! I got the Salmon Benedict dish. Another solid, very tasty meal! The salmon was fresher than the usual Ohio fare. Montreal uses Yukon golden potatoes, so anything with spuds automatically has a wonderful, almost \"sweet\" taste. Much fuller flavor than the regular 'ol white plain janes. My dish was incredible. The flavors were spot on. Loved the saut\u00e9ed onions and green pepper beneath the salmon. Yolk was over easy, sopped it up with the warm soft yet crunchy edged English muffin. The fresh fruit cup was a meal in itself. Cold, juicy and sweeeeeet!\n\nThis establishment will remain bookmarked for my next return trip here, no doubt. The excellent quality, matched with a very reasonable price point. The only thing that bums me is I can't bring this place closer to home.
We were staying at the Governour's hotel on Saint Hubert and wanted to try breakfast somewhere nearby before heading home. The menu at L'Oeufrier has something for everyone. From breakfast poutine to waffles and french toast. This is breakfast mecca. It was a Monday morning around 10am when we arrived, and we were seated right away. The host/server was attentive and brought us menus and coffee right away. At first he brought us menus in French; it is Montreal after all. I don't speak French, but I was actually having fun trying to figure out the dishes using pictures and my limited understanding of the language and language in general. The waiter saw this attempt, and realized we needed English menus. It made ordering easier, that's for sure. I ended up getting one of the breakfast poutines (since it was our last day and I hadn't had any poutine yet), the one with Emilia in the name. It had sausage, goat cheese, peppers, onions, and a bunch of tastiness, plus over easy eggs on top. My partner got a basic breakfast platter and we shared the chocolate banana brioche. Mmm mm mmm!  It was all really delicious. \nVery crisp and clean decor, friendly service, and worth a try if you're in the area looking for a casual bite to eat.
If you're looking for a trendy place this is not it. If you are looking for a good pie and wings than Il Primo is really good. I see some complaints about service but the service is decent just doesn't come with a smile. I'm an east coast guy looking for good pizza, I mostly do delivery so I don't care about the smile. in the valley of mediocre pizza this place stands out.
Probably the best ramen I've had in Pittsburgh. In general, though the city's been lacking in good ramen options over the past couple years, I'm finally glad to say that there is a place (this joint) in Pittsburgh that does serve acceptable ramen for the masses. The tonkotsu broth is not bad, definitely more flavorful and not as watered down as say, the broth that you get in ramen bowls at Ramen Bar, but it's definitely also not as flavorful as it could be. Noodles are pretty consistent and not too runny so I can definitely appreciate that (they have a bit of chew in them). Definitely eyed some of the other dishes when perusing the menu but I didn't have the stomach to eat everything I wanted. Will be back to try some of the other items & update review as appropriate. In general, great food & good service. Make sure to put down a reservation if you're coming on Friday nights or weekends as this place can get quite packed (it's really not that big, unfortunately)
Umami is place that I'd like to return to after a pleasant initial visit. It's fun how the location is tucked around the corner from Butler on 38th and having to navigate the unassuming doors and hallways that go up into the restaurant. I'm confirming that the stairs can be a bit much such as if you have knee problems and if there are other people going in the opposite direction as they are narrow but I did ok. Because Umami is an izakaya the space is small. \n\nI went with 2 other people and interestingly we were seated at a counter versus a table. Another odd thing that other reviewers have mentioned is that our waitress said everything on the menu is for sharing, including the ramen. I'll be ordering my own next time! In any case we ordered the following to share: the special fish robatayaki, bacon quail egg robatayaki, pork belly robatayaki, salmon temaki, tuna temaki, mackerel temaki, okonomiyaki and karaage. I would order everything again except for the special fish robatayaki as it was bland but everything else was delicious. One thing that was new to me were the plastic pippetts with soy sauce that came with the handrolls/temakis - I like how it controlled how much and when as I ate it!
We had dinner here last night and we will be back many times over. First off, such great atmosphere. Very cool carved out floor seating, great bar area, lighting etc.  We had made a reservation for four but when we got there it mistakenly had  been made for the night before. The staff was very gracious, providing us with champagne while we waited for a table.  Once seated we enjoyed amazing service as well as amazing food. Kristen was our server.  You gotta love a server who is knowledgeable and helpful with the menu but also knows how to have fun with her guests. #teamkristen. Chef Roger even accommodated my husband with a custom gluten free entree, also amazing.  The menu here is original, funky and delicious. The staff is kind and well trained. What a great addition to the restaurant scene in Lville. Thanks for a great dining experience.  See you soon!
This place is good...for Pittsburgh. The quality and the quantity left me wanting more.
Walking into (or up to) Umami set the tone for what was a completely non-traditional Pittsburgh late night experience.  We went to Umami hoping for sushi, but arrived too late, as they stop serving sushi before the rest of the kitchen closes.  Thankfully, there were so many other amazing small plate options we didn't miss the sushi at all!\n\nThe meat skewers were outrageously good...we tried the pork belly, and chicken thigh...and then 3 MORE pork belly skewers as they were on special for the late night happy hour.  Followed by the Takoyaki which was out of this world delicious.  We shared a Ramen bowl, and as recommended by our server ate that delightful 5-10 egg on it's own instead of mixing it in with the noodles.  I literally wanted to ask for a plate of those eggs all by themselves.  Sooo good.  The fried chicken with gravy dipping sauce was good, but at this point we realized our eyes were bigger than our stomachs...clearly a sign that we need to go back!\n\nI loved the atmosphere at Umami for a late night snack.  Dim red lighting, a DJ spinning house music that created a relaxing atmosphere with a touch of \"I almost want to get out of this seat and dance.\"  Our server was wonderful and took time to help us navigate the very unique menu.  My only mark against the restaurant is that it requires patrons to climb two flights of stairs and did not appear to be wheelchair accessible, which means a very close friend will not be able to visit Umami. I hope I am incorrect and that perhaps there is another entrance? That is the only reason for 4 stars...otherwise...I don't have a bad thing to say!  It truly is an authentic experience and I cannot wait to go back!
Very solid Chinese food, best in the area. I've had better but this does rank up there. We normally get the General Tso and the Moo Goo Gai Pan (both with fried rice) and it's consistently good. The quality of the meat is high, which is unfortunately rare for Chinese takeout. I've never dined in but the owner is very nice every time I'm in there.
I was here for their lunch special. I have been to Thailand multiple times growing up and love Thai food. I didn't expect much of this place given the setting and the price. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's tasty, pretty authentic, and with good Thai flavors. The food is on the spicy side so go lower on the spicy numbers and you can always add more.
Absolutely incredible. Definitely a hidden gem of the east side of town. Food is deliciously fresh and well prepared and the service is excellent. The prices are also very low for the quality/service.
Last Exit is a great place to see some of Arizona's finest local talent perform. You'll find bands like Violet Wild, Let Go, Source Victoria, Authority Zero and Ghetto Cowgirl rocking out at this super intimate live music venue, which features a small patio with misters. Up-and-coming national acts also grace the stage and you'll see the local music celebrity from time to time such as Robin Wilson of the Gin Blossoms or Roger Clyne of Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers. The beer is very cheap here and the bartenders are awesome.
Enjoyed a light lunch at Mr Nicks after visiting the HMY Brittania. Only went there as it's the first time I had seen a place advertise Gyros.  I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it was, very flavoursome.  I definitely would go back.
Cencis is a neighborhood Italian style restaurant. The owner grew up in the area and shows every sign of a true commitment to Wexford. They have a dining side and a bar side. Both are clean and comfortable. Now to the food....We haven't tried too many things because we absolutely love their cheese steak sandwiches. We always order them with double meat.....and they are delicious. One sandwich and a salad can feed two people. I would rank Cencis double meat cheese steak on par with the best of Philadelphia.\n\nI also like their Sicilian style pizza. Perfect combination of flavor, crunch and chewy.
Everything tasted fantastic! We did a Chef's tasting menu for $45/pp and weren't sure what to expect. But every dish we had was delicious. I'm not a big fan of coconut, but the flavour was never overpowering. And each dish had a good balance of heat. The cocktails were good too. The chicken 685 was my favourite & a must-try. \n\nService was great! The server also asked us which dishes on the menu we wanted to try most and he made sure that we got it. The only downside was that we were given 1 ice cream to share among 3 girls for dessert...A bigger portion or individual desserts, would have been better. \n\nWould definitely return!
Incredible. I've been twice. I am HUGE fan. It's my Favorite place in Toronto at the moment. Order the Beef or the Coconut chicken. Actually order anything - you won't be dissapointed.
Good ambiance and great good. Very very authentic Thai food. A must thai place to go when visiting Las Vegas
Let me start by saying this restaurant is best for carry-out with limited seating if you choose to dine in. Today I ordered their spring rolls for my appetizer and they came in the rice paper (still feeling nostalgic about the crunch and peanut sauce). For my main course, I ordered the beef salad and fried chicken fried rice.\n\nDishes that are WINNERS:\nChinese brocoli & crispy fried pork which is amazing\nSpicy Catfish - boneless fried catfish with fresh vegetables in a light spicy sauce\nChinese sausage & bbq pork fried rice - seasoned perfectly\nBeef Salad- tender pieces of beef with an array of veggies \nFried chicken over fried rice- The chicken is juicy and not overdone and the rice has onions and tomato's. \n\nEverything I've tried here is a winner so far in my book. I'll be sure to try \"three buddies\" next time since a lot of people say its good.
Very friendly, family owned, good food, fast service, spotlessly clean -- and inexpensive.
Probably the best Thai food I've had in Vegas! Tasty food, great prices, friendly people. The only thing I might improve is the dining room, as it's not the most comfortable place to eat. If I could, I'd rate this place 4.5 stars, and recommend takeout versus dining in.
100% amazing.\n\nAs I made an early morning leave from Phoenix we popped in here for a breakfast burrito which was AMAZING, and some tamales that were absolutely perfect. The big winner here though.. the homemade tortillas I purchased and took home. I can't even begin to tell you how GOOD they were. I even had people in LA freaking out at how delicious they are and I must find out if they will ship me a bag or 2.\n\nThe place is pretty bustling in the morning and I would easily, EASILY go back here for more. Staff is great and the food is authentic.\n\nbut seriously.. buy their tortillas. I'm not even kidding.
Food was alright... The wrap was stuffed with ranch. The waitress was slow with service. I also saw her eating out of a bowl of french fries the cooks left for her near all the waiting orders. Not only that but a cook was munching on food in the kitchen while getting tasks done. Overall bad staff and a overpriced meal.
Worst service ever.  Never came around for a refill and had to go to bar to pay the bill.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!
Although I cannot comment about their food yet, I am writing a review to commend Piano Piano's great customer service! We came on a random Tuesday night and was particularly surprised by how busy it was. We were welcomed by the manager/owner (?) and was asked if it was okay for us to sit at the bar since the restaurant was pretty full. This worked to our advantage since we were able to watch the bar tender craft his drinks while enjoying the view of the rest of the restaurant. Although we didn't stay long since we only came for dessert, we still enjoyed our time. Shoutout to the bar tender who was friendly and very accommodating with our questions regarding the drinks he made. We were also surprised to learn that he sells his own line of Bitters! \n\nI ordered tiramisu to share while my bf had an espresso. To be honest, the tiramisu was nothing special from the ones I've had before. However, it came in a cute fancy little tea cup (think of the ones you have for afternoon English tea parties!), which I thought was interesting.  \n\nGreat ambience, friendly staff and accommodating service! Looking forward to my next visit to actually try their dishes and cocktail options!
We tried the spaghetti pomodoro after our waitor told us it was Chef Scott's signature dish and featured as the best pasta in Food and Wine magazine. It did not disappoint. The bread cart is life changing. The veal and pork meatballs and the roasted beets were delicious as well. The sangria paired perfectly with the meal. All of the food was very well seasoned and the customer service was spot on. Our waiter, Jeff, was great! I will definitely be back.
This restaurant, now called Sai Sushi, was previously En Sushi and is still on this Yelp listing as of this date.  My husband and I have gone several times to this restaurant and loved it.  We have traveled across town for years to our favorite sushi place but now we don't have to go outside Anthem!  We have been pleasantly surprised at the quality, flavor, decor & cleanliness.  The servers are so nice and accommodating.  The sushi chef, Aiden, is the bomb.  Love it!
Good for take out / delivery because you can order directly on Yelp. Large portions & interesting combinations. Not the best sushi of my life but it was good quality for take out.
Holy Tacos and Salsa Bar!!!!!! This place is the real deal. We came here 10 minutes after opening and we were glad we did. This place filled up quickly and for good reason. The tacos were incredible. The spicy pork, the beef, the white fish all mouth watering. The refried beans and rice served on the side tasted awesome, I just wish the portions were larger. Right away we were served large baskets of warm tortilla chips and we tried every salsa at the bar. Some were very spicy!!!! I enjoyed the cilantro cream one on the fish tacos. The quesadilla came with avocado slices on top and the cheese was very tasty. These tacos were gourmet! I really enjoyed everything we ate here and would definitely come back. Prices are fair as well. They staff kept refilling our glasses of water and kept checking in on us. We had a great lunch here.
This is a great place for gyros,  the cucumber sauce is excellent,  also all their food is very good.   A great place to eat in or take out. I recommend this restaurant to all my family and friends.
solid wings for a great price. this is the definition of a dive bar. wouldn't come here to watch a game, have a beer or even dine in. i will however continue to order the wings for take out at least twice a month.
Updating my review after making several more visits. This taco bell sucks. They have things on the menu that they aren't even selling yet (and the employee's haven't even heard of the item). They don't know what any of the specialty sauces are called. Twice now, I've gotten a side of chipotle sauce & spicy ranch, with barely anything in the container, for .30 cents. Constantly missing items. Incompetent yet polite employees. I am done giving this place chances!
Very delicious!  And the price is amazing!  Any of the items on their menu are a great choice!  My favourites are the grilled beef, pork belly, and lavong fish.
I ordered the grilled chicken banh mi, grilled chicken steamed bao and the sweet potato fries with curry sauce. The banh mi was really good and tasty. Baguette was skinny and fluffy (didn't hurt the roof of your mouth). Great sandwich. The steamed bao I ordered for my toddler was ok.. Really simple. chicken, some sauce sauce and cucumber slices. I would order the banh mi instead for my son next time. Sweet potato fries with curry sauce was surprisingly a tasty combination.
We just ate from here .. Food was good portions was nice it was halal .. The owner and chef greeted with Asalamoalikum.. They even reheated my pizza again .. Very courteous .. They let us pray there .. I definitely recommend .. It's a nice and clean little restaurant .. We also ordered Philly cheese burger ....
We had chicken wings with fries and a chicken parm with fries! Mmmmhh. Very good food! The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly! I would highly recommend this place! And a plus side, they are open late!  The guys that work here are funny and they also got our food out quickly while joking! Nothing better!
Normally we are happy with Panera brand, but not this location. When we got home (10/22) half of our order was missing, so we called them and went back to get our sandwiches that were not ready. Got home to find 1 square inch of chicken and (hard) unripened avocado on each half of the Chipotle chicken avocado sandwich. Overall disappointing experience.
I really like this particular Panera at The District.  It has a warmer ambience, food is fresher and a little more spacious.
Alex needs to learn about customer service ... been ordering from here for years and she has no communication skills or customer service skills. Will not be ordering any more!
Delicious food. Excellent choice of menu items.Must try lettuce tofu wrap and seafood jambalaya with linguini pasta
Wandering around on my final day in Vegas I happened upon there great happy hour deals at this place.  They have quite a few discount food items and drink specials but, I was just here to partake in some food.\n\nI took a seat at the bar and was quickly greeted by a bartender.  The menu is huge in addition to the happy hour deals.  Another bartender came up to take my order and I ordered calamari, egg rolls and the shitake mushroom garlic noodles.  The bartender looked at me and said you do know that they are full size orders for happy hour?  I said yes I do, um I like food and we both laughed.\n\nSome nice tourists from Utah sat next to me and we had some great conversation before my food arrived.  The shitake mushroom garlic noodles were my favorite part of the order.  They were light with a hearty full flavor sauce that stuck to the noodles well.  This was probably enough to fill me up in hindsight.  The calamari was a 4 star dish but, the egg rolls were just ok in my book.\n\nThis is one of the better happy hours on the strip for pricing vs. food quality.  The bartenders were spot on with their service and I would definitely stop back by the next time I am in town.
The poster child for hole in the wall Mexican food. Amazing food for amazing prices. The breakfast burritos are the highlight of the menu. Their hot sauce they provide is lights out. Not too spicy but just enough kick. \n\nIf you're looking for a step up from the Filibertos of the world, this is your place.
Dear Reviewers,\nDo not go here. The ice cream taste funny and if you want a refund they cannot issue you one since they use a credit machine. To save all the hassle just avoid it unless you want to take a chance. I went and asked for a blizzard and all I was ice cream with crumbs literally all crumbs no solid pieces and the lady charged me a little more. I asked for a oreo cheesecake blizzard and she started adding things up that almost equal 5$ I didn't question her then after I got my blizzard I started digging through and there was nothing in it. I asked if she added anything and she just nodded. But then as I ate the ice cream it wasn't good so I asked can I get a refund she told me no right away and said to pick something else. I asked if she could void the transaction and again I got a no. She just told me to pick something else. So I did but still not satisfied.
We came here for the beer selection. We ordered and the waiter insisted we try a taste first. It took 20 minutes to get the \"taste\". Immediately said bring the pints. Another 20 minutes. So we sat there for 40 minutes without a drink. Ironically the appetizer showed up before the beer. This was on a sunday night with less than 40 people there. Would have been a much bigger tab if service was reasonable, just an fyi for management.
Very accommodating and friendly service. French onion soup was not the best I've had, but decent. My boyfriend got the surf n turf burger, which looked amazing. Very reasonable prices on the strip!! Will definitely go back.
9/10 \n\nGreat staff! They are so friendly and helpful. The food is very delicious and they give you a good amount for the price. \n\nThe cheese curds appetizer is so addicting. Its the perfect amount of crunchy and gooey. They give you a lot too. After sharing this appetizer with my boyfriend I was already getting full. \n\nThe mac n cheese is very good and the portions are great. \n\nWould recommend eating here. They have a very wide menu.
So happy that there's a Yardhouse in Vegas! Extensive selection of beers, wine, and cocktails. Service was quick and friendly, our server recommended great beers all night. Girlfriend and I had the southern fried chicken and vampire tacos. Large portions at affordable prices. The chicken was delicious and huge and came with plenty of sides. Vampire tacos was flavorful, outer shell was crispy, crunchy, and kept all the delicious fillings from spilling out. This was such a great find in Vegas, we actually came back the next day for lunch.
This place is AWESOME! Great food selection (literally a little bit of everything!) and 145 beers on tap! Amazing happy hour as well! Will definitely be back!!
We are frequent visitors to Yardhouse.  We began going to the Long Beach location when they opened and have been loyal customers ever since.  We love the beer selection and the food is great but we go because of the awesome service.  We recently went to the LINQ location off the strip and were blown away.  Ali and Joshua made our day.  It was the last day of our trip and they made it amazing.  They made us feel right at home, suggested local brews, and kept us happy and engaged.  It may seem silly that a lunch can make your day but truly, they made ours.  With all the selections in vegas often with rude and disinterested wait staff this Yardhouse blows them all away.  If you want a near endless beer selection, great food  with a huge menu, and seriously unmatched service head to Yardhouse at the LINQ.
Amazing experience here.... I use to work for the one in Rancho Cucamonga but the one here In Vegas is awesome. And I probably would have to owe all the credit to Bernard our server who was polite, knowledgeable, attentive, and just a delight to talk to! You are awesome!!! From one server to another stay awesome! \n\nAnd the food is always good and drinks as well! Had to give the yard house credit!
Went to the Yard House last evening after the Legends shows at the Flamingo Hotel for a late dinner.  The menu was extensive and I ended up getting, Korean Short Rib Tacos.  It came with spicy rice and beans.  It liked small but  to be honest, it was a perfect sized portion for that late in the evening.  It was fresh and very tasty.  My partner had a burger with shoestring fries.  He liked it but he only ate half because he was not too hungry.  He asked for the burger with cheese and pickles only, and they mistakenly added garlic aioli.  He tries it and he say it was fine.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, the extremely nice waiter said he will buy us dessert because if the mistake.  It was but necessary but very nice. \n\nThe meal was very good and we recommend it to anyone because of  the large menu, delicious food and the great service.
Chances are you've already hit this spot a few times in your dining/going out for drinks career. We all have. Honestly, I can't say I've had many pleasant experiences here. Prior to this past Friday the food had always been sub par and the service so-so. \n\nThat all changed when I ordered their chicken nachos and the other three people in my party all had burgers. Everything was absolutely spot on. The nachos were gigante (hee-gaunt-a)! The chicken was super moist, almost like it came from a rotisserie. That's pretty key because the chicken on nachos is usually dry and stringy. Not this time. The red salsa they put on it was really good too. Enough cheese and guac as well as sour cream really led this to be the dish I had been waiting all week for and didn't know it. Super good. Everyones burgers appeared to be solid as well - I think all 4 members of the group were honorary members of the \"Clean Plate Club.\" The service was good enough - dont' recall the servers name, but he kept the drinks full for the most part, gave us enough time to look at their gigantic menu. The only thing that I didn't care for was that I asked him if he could put on the UNLV basketball game. I don't know if it was on TV or not, but he never was able to get the game on and he never mentioned it again. I would have appreciated some sort of acknowledgment - that said, it was crazy busy and I can totally excuse the oversight. \n\nAfter a few bad experiences I'm happy to report out a good one. I definitely won't avoid this place as openly as I had in the past. Great turnaround and Yard House always has a lively atmosphere which I like.
Last time we were here I had the Garlic Salmon and he had the Ribs. Both were excellent. We ended up on the patio section of the seating and there was a musician playing on the promenade just across the way. It was so wonderful, the perfect setting. Great beer selection and impressive menu variety. We have been here multiple times and sometimes service can be pretty slow.
Normally good and consistent with food and service, but last night was a disappointment. I'm shocked by the high volume of people who go through the restaurant that their bathrooms were in bad shape. If that is how their bathrooms look, I hate to see how they manage the kitchen.
Was excited to try this Yardhouse at the Linq and check out the promenade too.  Yardhouse was delicious, lots of vegetarian options and great happy hour! Kelsey our server was friendly and helpful, and manager Dave was cool and went above and beyond! Will definitely come back!
Gardein meatless options, massive beer selection.  Good happy hour prices.  Sit outside to see the Linq.
Sheesha bar sympa au coin de College et Bathurst. Grandes tables : id\u00e9al pour les groupes. \n\n// Sheesha bar at College and Bathurst. The good stuff here are the huge tables for the groups.
I love it here! The LINQ's Yard House is such an amazing restaurant to visit with friends and family. \n\nMy friends and I weren't very hungry, so we were planning on splitting tons of appetizers and snacks, which was nice because the servers didn't force us to order expensive entr\u00e9es. \n\nWe ordered sweet potato fries, regular fries, buffalo wings with barbecue sauce, chicken strips, and I -- being a pescatarian -- ordered a baja fish taco. LOVED IT. Everything I ate was perfectly cooked with tons of flavor. \n\nOverall, I had a great time here. The servers were nice and patient while the food stayed consistently deeelicious.
Big shout out to the manager and wait staff for seating my family, 21 people in all and we didn't have to wait forever! Thanks for working with us. Food and drinks were great like at every other Yardhouse. I really liked the BBQ chicken pizza (my cousin ordered it)! Yum! Service was great. Having two waiters and multiple staff delivering food and drinks help tremendously. We were all really hungry and thirsty. I will be back before I leave!
Service was terrible and food wasn't that great. Still have money on my gift card so I guess that's going on beer instead. $44.40 for a burger, chicken plate, wings and 2 waters.
Possibly the best burger I've ever eaten.\n\nMy brother hyped up this restaurant and I was dubious.  Never the less, the Original Flame fully delivered, being incredibly juicy and flavorful.  It was also quite greasy, but in a less offensive way than traditional fast food burgers.  The waffle fries (my favorite!) were crispy and perfectly salted.\n\nWe also sampled the chicken nuggets, which, unfortunately, were highly lacking.  I was expecting full breast meat tenders, but we got dinosaur shaped pressed meat (not unlike the ones they sell at Costco).  I believe these are a temporary item to be replaced soon.  But they were highly disappointing compared to the sheer awesomeness that is the Original Flame.\n\nThe facility itself was only slightly lacking, with tables that needed a bit more wiping down and a condiment and cutlery table that was in slight disarray.  Still, the staff was incredibly friendly, and the food was prepared lightning fast.\n\nI will definitely be back for another Flame burger, though probably not too frequently, as I could feel my arteries tighten shortly after my last bite.  Burger greatness comes at a price, but is undeniably monumental.
Quick and dirty restaurant. Cheapy food, finish and go. HK style tea is delicious, but horrible washroom.
My hubby and I eat here almost once a week and I refuse to eat Thai anywhere else...at least in Mesa.  We always do take out...cheaper that way. So I don't know how good they are as far as service, etc but we've never had any problems with take out.  The food is excellent!  I usually get yellow curry with chicken and my husband gets pad Thai extra spicy.  Their pineapple fried rice is yummy too!  Love this place!
I adore this place. The people are wonderful and so is the food. We always get yellow chicken  curry and lately we have been getting the shrimp/squid tom yum soup. It's without a doubt our favorite thing there now. Your body will love it. Tastes great and good for you! We try to g at least once a week, but sometimes that turns into 5 or 6 times a week.
Thought about giving it a four because we waited for a long time since they are not very organized with their waiting list (they don't have one) and even once we sat down it was still another hour before we got our food... However, this is by far the best Thai food in town! I can't wait to go back to try more dishes. Just don't plan on going at busy times, like Friday nights :-/
Our first time trying this place from other older great reviews.  This is 6-19-2013....very disappointed in the watery curries, we ordered both mossaman and panang.  The Thai fried rice had corn and peas in it, and it's advertised as egg, onion, green onion and meat.  The owner said I was looking at an old menu, but didn't show me the new one.  Other people have complained about the watery curries.  According to the owner who reluctantly gave me a refund, \"Most people like watery, but we can make it thick.\"  The fried wontons were not hot and tasted stale, and did not have cream in them just some find of ground something.  The \"sweet and sour sauce,\" was seriously like water, and bright orange, but again the owner said that is normal for Thai.  There was no thickness to it at all.  The Thai Egg Rolls my 17 year old took one bite and would not eat the rest.  The only thing we ordered that was decent was the Pad Thai, and it was very good.  Extremely disappointed.  I had to take all my leftover food back which was fine, and reluctantly she agreed to give me a refund.  But she said she had been in business for 10 years, and no one had ever made any complaints [really?].  The young daughter who looked 14 or 15 was very nice and did the refund.  I am changing my rating to two stars, simply because I did get a refund, but I do not recommend this place.  And when I got there at 5 PM, there were no customers in the restaurant.  The owner asked me to explain the problems, and I said in front of the customers again, but she told me the man was family....never again for us.  I do feel badly that I had to rate this restaurant as I did, but I think others should be aware.  Soooo, what she told me was people need to order things the way they want them in the future.  I said, \"why don't you just ask people upfront do you want watery or thick curries?\" Enough said!
There is some sort of magical deliciousness that Subba sprinkles over everything I've ordered there. The momo (dumplings) are delicious; the vegetable biryani is delicious; the veggie Nepali dish is delicious. Raita and lassi are also great. The menu lists \"Indian tea,\" which is code for chai--it's great. Also for some reason the prices are from like 1995. It's nuts.\n\nService is extremely solicitous and sweet and friendly, from some very nice guys who also seem to work in the kitchen and don't speak especially strong English. Expect to wait a few minutes for them to come out and help you, but if you wave them over they're happy to help immediately.\n\nMy parents and I went to a few fancy well-known restaurants around Pittsburgh and our best meal by a wide margin was at the divey, homey, very inexpensive, crazily delicious Subba.
I was so incredibly impressed with this place! I can't wait to go back and try more.\n\nIt's a little nondescript on the outside and I might have had trouble finding it if I wasn't with a friend who had been there before. It's not the fanciest place in the world and it's on the second level of the building, so you have to walk up a large flight of stairs that does NOT feel like its leading to a restaurant. The layout and decor might be difficult or intimidating for some people, but I promise it's worth it! Get up those stairs.\n\nThe menu seemed to be a mix of American-Chinese, Nepalese and Indian food. We started with the chicken momos, which were dumplings served with a very spicy dipping sauce. My friend and I both ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein while our other friend ordered a spicy curry pork dish. I can say hands down it was the best Lo Mein I've ever had in my life. The portions are huge and I'm embarrassed to admit that I still ate the whole thing. I couldn't help myself. Everyone loved their meals and we all cleaned our (very large) plates.\n\nWe chatted with the owner, asking for menu recommendations and he was very friendly! I'll definitely be going back here soon!
Came here on a Friday night when there was live music. The owners (I assume) were both working and awesome, I could tell they had a lot going on with so many people in there, but did not lack on service. The guy playing the live music had the voice of an angel and totally killed it. My boyfriend and I both had the Malbec and got a glass of dessert wine on the house before we left. When I come back next time, I will definitely be ordering some of the food there, it ALL looked delicious from what other people had ordered around us. This location is awesome too, the patio is wonderful for this time of year!
Right off the bat what you will notice as soon as you walk in is the amount of peace compared to other places. I could actually have a conversation without any noise . Small, cozy spot with a great hearty broth full of flavor without the saltiness and bloat. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The apps were nothing to rave about the dumplings were cold. Service was friendly. I'd definitely go back.
Despite the weather, I still love eating ramen!\n\nHere at Hakata Ramen, the seating is pretty tight and tiny. I believe we sat at the only \"big\" table which seated 6 people.\n\nGreeted with welcome in Japanese, we took our seat and looked at the menu. Personally, I really enjoyed the decor of Hakata Ramen because it looked really unique compared to some of the other ramen places that I've been.\n\nTo be frank, the menu didn't have a huge selection, as they specialize in Tonkotsu ramen with only slight variations of it. However, they do offer more toppings for extra cost, shown in the back of the menu. You can also choose to have wavy or straight noodles for your ramen:) !\nThey also serve Ghost Peppers here, if you're willing to try that. I saw a video of someone eating ghost peppers and I am terrified of what it does....\n\nWe ordered a karaage to share and that came last among all our ramen. I really liked it!! It was crispy on the outside but tender meat was chewy on the inside. It was also prepped fresh as it was pipping hot when we got it.\nI believe one of the sauce was mayonnaise, but I'm not sure what the red one was.\n\nThis was the original Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen! It came with corn, green onion, bean sprout, black mushrooms and char siew/pork belly.\n\nI ordered the Red Hot Tonkotsu Ramen which was roughly the same, except they have a special homemade spicy sauce/paste and chili added towards the dish. The paste is seen on the spoon given, in that huge lump. I tried the paste before mixing it, and it tasted really bitter and horrid...\nBut after mixing the paste with the broth and it tasted great:) !\n\nMost of us got wavy noodles, but I got straight noodles instead. & I actually like the straight noodles better because it was more firm compared to the wavy.\n\nHakata Ramen was tended by 1 server when we were there. He had to take orders, clean up, attend to cash as well as serve us the noodles when the time calls for it. Surprisingly, he spoke pretty good Japanese as well because we overheard a customer who interacted with him in Japanese and their conversation was flowing smoothly.\nI actually enjoyed my time at Hakata Ramen. The ramen filled me up nicely as my dinner, and the broth was quite tasteful as well. I kind of wish they had more ramen choices as they only had about 5 options and maybe 2 don choices in their menu.\n\nNevertheless, I still enjoyed my time here, but I don't recommend going in a huge group!
I've been here a couple times, and it always amazes me how CAPCOM hasn't sent this place a cease-and-desist letter or potential copyright-infringement for the artistic freedoms based on their Street Fighter art. But that's another story for another day on another site...\n\nRestaurant size:\nCozy, about 6 tables for 2-4 patrons each and 2 bar-style bench tables. However, I've ever only seen the window-facing bar seating used, which can squeeze maybe 5-6 people. If you come here with more than 1 person and want to face each other, be prepared to wait a bit...\n\nFood quality:\nA fan of the black tonkotsu broth! But there could be a bit more meat and noodles, although there IS an option to get extra noodles or a noodles refill for $2. Is a pre-tax/tip black tonkotsu broth w/ extra noodle worth it? That's up to you to find out! If you're ultra hungry, pieces of karage and a tonkotsu ramen might not cut it for you...\n\nService:\nVery friendly, helpful and accommodating servers! but please be patient as sometimes there may be miscommunication due to the music volume -OR- misunderstanding; you may need to explain certain terms more than once, or describe it with simpler English. \n\nRamen arrives quickly after ordering!\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIf you'd like to marvel at the Street Fighter-inspired art while enjoying a quick bowl of ramen, you should consider coming in! If you're with a large group...you might want to reconsider -OR- LIVE XTREME AND COME IN!!!111
There were only 2 other occupied tables when I walked in for dinner on a weeknight. It was pretty quiet but there was some Bob Marley & the Wailers music playing the whole time. \n\nThis was my first time here and I ordered the avocado fries, which were good, but they didn't blow me away. I also noticed that a lot of the items on the menu say they are spicy but I got the shrimp fajitas, which were marked spicy, and there wasn't a kick to it at all. But that is in no way a complaint. They were actually very very good and came in such a large portion. I was extremely satisfied!\n\nThere is no parking lot for this location, so we parked on the street, which I believe is free after 6 in that area (but don't quote me on that!)
Late night hunger with limited choices and usually having good experiences at Denny's my bf and I chose to eat Denny's on a Wednesday early morning (12am). The place was not very busy but it took FOREVER to get our food. It took a while to get our order taken but once taken I ordered a sandwich with a salad (very limited cooking involved) and my bf ordered the Moons Over my Hammy. The salad must have taken 30 minutes to come out. A side salad does not take much preparation time. I at the salad and much much MUCH later our sandwiches came out and they were wrong. I ordered tomato with mine, easy sauce, It came without tomato and a lot of spread. I felt like the cooks could care less that it took forever. The waitresses seemed a little more in tune but it seems like everyone was slacking off. I think the manager was there and he too was slacking. There was a lot of bickering going on between the waitresses and the cooks. The total time there exceeded an hour and half... FOR A COUPLE OF SANDWICHES!! By far the worst Denny's Ive been to. So sad because I usually like Denny's. The manager needs to get it together and make sure the staff is running efficiently and smoothly.
I never had a case of food poisoning before. This was by far the most horrendous experience I have ever had. Nothing like missing New Year's Eve because of someone else's incompetence. I will never eat at another Denny's as long as I live. \nThe manager promised I would receive a call regarding my condition, and more than 24 hours later my phone hasn't rung. Rest assured, I will be calling the dept of Heath. Shame on you!
One of the most unappreciated place for a dining option is Denny's. I always feel they get the bum rap because of the way on how cheap fast comfort food was made that goes in hand with a down to earth people that is servicing you.\n\nIt seemed like it's beneath for anyone whenever this place get chosen as the dining option. We always takes it for granted because it opened 24 hours and it would always be a fall back plan in case the better restaurant down the Vegas strip was full.\n\nThis place is the good ol' reliable. A few times when we need to grab a hearty breakfast before we hit the road home, we always stopped by here instead of launching into a gorge feast at another buffet.\n\nGoodness gracious, haven't we ate enough?\n\nI just love the folksy charm of the place with friendly smile and the ever refillable hot coffee that is ready for you. I still can't get over the jam on the butter white toast and the hot scrambled egg with sausage. The only thing I would skip was the rubber pancakes, but people still love'em.\n\nThis place never gets the appreciation from many diners until you need them, but I just can't get over the fact we'll get the young couples who just got hitch getting the congrats from a trucker who is about to hit the long road to Utah. Or the fact that a high roller would be spending here instead of guzzing it up in his hotel room for dining in room service.\n\nNothing beats Denny for a hearty meal on the Vegas strip. Just make sure you come early enough because everyone in town will have the same thing in their mind.\n\nLet's just hope they are still at the slot machine when you get here.
Worst Denny's ever. My wife and I waited for 45 minutes for a to go order. I truly believe we only waited so long because we were starving. I asked one cashier for a refund and her exact word were, \"I can't give you a refund.\" It was an Asian lady. Even after seeing people who order 10-15 minutes after us get there food before us they managed to give us the wrong order. Also not giving me the eggs I paid for. The service here is heinous and unfit. They offered to give us some complimentary items but at 4:45 am I didn't have the patience for it. They're lucky I can't give them zero stars.
Same food but the good news , only place around where you don't spend 100 plus for breakfast and you know what to expect however the service and food was better in this location
Decided to try the fried chicken at this place just to see if I could put it on the \"guilty pleasures\" list.  Never again.  The chicken was undercooked, and pink. As a result, the drumsticks were sinewy, and inedible. I'm still searching for Toronto's best fried chicken.
This place is a typical cheap dive-y spors bar. It had the feel of an American Legion hall. \n\nI felt much better about my life after seeing some of the regulars there.
What an evening we had! This is the real deal. Ambiance. Food. Wine. Service. Four of us. Started in the bar for a glass of wine and hors d'oeuvres at happy hour. Bartender was great. She was attentive but never hovered. Moved into the diningroom for dinner. The ambiance was old school, white tablecloths, dark wood and leather. It felt cozy and classy. We thought perhaps a Soprano or two might show up!! Could this really be in a strip mall instead of NYC or SF? Two of us ordered the same dish. Two of us different dishes. We were all thrilled with rich flavors and portions. Our waiter was service at its best. He recited multiple dinner specials without a hitch, listened to us, engaged us, charmed us and was set on making this our best memory. He went over and above to fulfill a request for dessert. \nFINALLY the Italian restaurant we have searched the valley to find....we want to tell the world AND we want to keep it to ourselves....but that would really be selfish!\nWonderful place to go with friends and share a memorable evening.....ambiance. food. wine. SERVICE. Go! (Probably great grown up date night, too. You can hear one another!!)
Stallone with the earrings is good to look at but not as good as these croutons in my Caesar salad. The food is delicious and Kim Crawford coming in clutch with the Sav blanc..
I went there this past Saturday night 11/16/13 and ordered the flounder.  It was supposed to come with a side salad and two sides.  I cannot eat salad so ordered the soup.  Turns out they don't have soup. I decided to substitute the salad with something else on the menu, like the mixed vegetables.  Turns out they don't have mixed vegetables which is on the menu.  So I asked for the rice, which is also on the menu and the waitress said they don't have rice either.  So instead of the rice I ordered a baked potato.  That's all she brought.  Broiled flounder, which was very good and a baked potato, which was the usual baked potato.  She did not ask me if I wanted a different appetizer to substitute for the lack of a salad or another side since they didn't have the rice on the menu.  She didn't even ask me if I wanted tarter sauce or cocktail sauce so I ate it straight up.  It was still good.\nMy friend ordered the salad and shrimp scampi (very small portion) and pasta as the side.  We got garlic bread which was too thick and not enough butter.  (well, I'm sure it was margarine or some sort of oil).\nI have been to this restaurant many times in the 34 years I have lived n Belmont, even when it was a Chinese restaurant.  It used to have the best pizza in town but frankly, Simonetti's is far better and I don't expect to go back to Dimetrio's.  My friend liked it but he loves everything so he is no quality assurance judge.\nI would recommend Demetrio's for pizza only and take-out, not dine-in.  If you want good fish in Belmont go to catfish Cove or Amber Jack's Or Captain D's, all of which are very good!
So glad we tried this place for AYCE Sushi. Fantastic service and we really liked the atmosphere. The sushi selection was spot on and the Salmon was fresh and a nice portion on the Nigiri. Was sad to see there wasn't too many people in the restaurant for lunch but that didn't stop the staff from being really welcoming and cheery.  Bonzai Roll was my favorite.
Great service! Excellent food. Close to home. A little pricey though but overall no complaints. Happy hour is 3 to 8p and 20% off. Most places though is 50% off. They serve small desert after...no charge.
Pizza Shack is a Pittsburgh institution. It's not in the heart of the city, but off 51 in the South Hills. It's easy to pass by without a second glance, especially because it is closed most of the time.\n\nCall ahead for a pizza, and it's guaranteed that (if they're open) they're very busy at any time of night. I recommend ordering a plain pizza, but all of the toppings I have tried are pretty good too. Plain just hits the perfect balance of flavour, in my opinion. When you come to pick it up, sometimes you can grab a chat with the owners, who are friendly and quirky to talk to.\n\nThe pizza comes as a square. Some of the pieces have crust, others do not. The crust it crispy and almost like a dense pastry, but the sauce is sweet like stewed tomatoes and jam... or something like that. Just try it. It's so worth it.
Omg!!! From the sushi to service... 5 stars well deserved!! Sushi was so fresh and happy hour was a win win!! It was so hard to choose from the selection but our server was so patient and friendly. She recommended a few specialty rolls and we couldn't decide which were our favorite. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Did I mention happy hour! ;)
So the one star that I'm giving goes for the sushi which is really good when done correctly. I spent a lot of time in north Scottsdale working and I love sushi so this place seemed perfect. I have now given them four chances and been disappointed each time mostly with the customer service. I have found large chunks of plastic in my sushi roll and when I called to have my order refunded I talk to three separate managers and no one ever refunded my money. It honestly got to the point where I was just tired of calling so I took the loss. They have also double charged my card, and charged me regular price for beers during happy hour. Still the sushi is good so against my better judgment I went back tonight. I will give them the mistake was mine, I ordered a crunchy roll by mistake instead of a tootsie roll. I was willing to take the loss of 4$ difference in price and just switch them out. I understand it was my mistake. But again big eye sushi is only concerned with taking your money. I was told I would need to buy another roll even though I didn't want to keep both rolls. I understand that is their prerogative but I will no longer be patronizing this restaurant. I have worked in customer service for many years and I know that the savings of at most 12$ for the crunchy roll doesn't make sense at the loss of a repeat customer. Oh well good thing north Scottsdale has a lot of other sushi restaurants!
Good prices and good quality sushi!
Found this place while we were in town for the weekend! We had a craving for sake & sushi and this place was close by so we gave it a try. We were both glad we did! \n\nYohan was our sushi chef and recommended a couple rolls. We got the Cherry Blossom, Las Vegas and Baked Scallop rolls and baked green mussels. All of it looked amazing and tasted even better! \n\nThey have happy hour all day so sake bombs were only $7!! The food was delicious and we had an awesome time! \n\nWish we could take Big Eye Sushi back to LA with us!!!
Condescending service and sub par service.
HOORAY FOR MELTED CHEESE... and chocolate and mapley stuff!  \nWe were on a quest as touristy tourists for some decent fondue.  This was recommended and rightly so.  The service was fantastique as was the fondue.  I mean, it's hard to eff up melted and boiled things but hey... they did it right. Plus I think only one guys works there... as host, waiter, cook, etc.  It's a pretty cute old building too.
Any new restaurant is going to have growing pains whether management is new to the business or not. I didn't experience that here, though. They are still expanding their seating areas and the main patio will soon be covered. Expect it to be busy and that they may have slight issues with seating until things get rolling! I ordered the pork shoulder which was excellent. I ordered the cornbread and BBQ chips as sides and unfortunately the cornbread still had an hour to cook, so hopefully I'll get to try that next time. The seasoning on the BBQ chips was tasty, but I prefer my chips to be a little less browned. My husband ordered a burger which was huge. Service was fast and our food arrived quickly, and we thought they were large portions for the cost. Our first experience was great and will be back. They're just getting started!
Having read lots of good reviews, I decided to try My Thai for myself one Saturday night recently.  I have always been a big fan of Thara Thai, but thought I should broaden my Thai food horizons a little.\n\nFirst, I have to say, the crab rangoon definitely lives up to the great reviews here!  It's a refreshing change from the usual commercial fare.  I personally would have liked it to be cooked just a tiny bit longer, but it was still the best I've had in a long while.\n\nI ordered the Tom Kha Gai soup, but it was a far cry from what I usually have for this soup. The soup was very bitter, and almost inedible (for me, anyway). The broth had very little flavor, and I couldn't get past the overpowering bitterness.  Perhaps it just had more of something than I was used to having. It was definitely a disappointment though.\n\nMy entree was Pad See Ew (chicken), ordered to be spiced as a 2 on their 1-4 scale.  I definitely should have gone higher.  I thought it was a bit bland, but overall a very average dish.  I felt the portion size for the money was pretty good, in comparison to other establishments around.\n\nI will give them a few more chances.  Bonus star for delivering to west Champaign, which is a bigger oddity than you would think.  They have a diverse menu, so I'm sure I will find opportunity to try more items.  The president's fried rice has received good reviews here, so that might be my next adventure at My Thai. :)
Johnny Mango is one of my go-to favorites in Cleveland. I moved recently but visit Johnny Mango's every time I'm in town. Their Bangkok chicken is worth the wait, but I always order the Bus Boy Special (the grain, green and bean of the day) and I've never been disappointed. I'm especially excited when bok choy is the veggie of the day, it's wonderful! The guac is worth the cash and the pad thai never disappoints. Love Johnny Mango's! Ask about their loyalty program, they don't advertise it much.
Last night, JMs accommodated my last minute request to seat 10 people. We were arriving within the hour on a Friday night. And they did so with a smile and excellent service. I'm sure we were annoying with our seperate checks and sporadic arrival and indecision. But our server was fantastic. \n\nAs always, food was delicious. I had the Pad Thai but the burritos also looked amazing. The daily specials are always unique. The menu is well rounded and will suit vegetarians, vegans, carnivores, and everything in between. (Which is why a group of 10 agreed on JMs.)\n\nMargaritas. What can I say except get a pitcher. And call a cab.
Kyoto House is located on Brock Street in Whitby, about three streets north of Dundas in a small plaza. If you weren't looking for it, it would be easy to pass by, especially since there's construction in the area.\n\nI came here upon a recommendation from a friend of a friend. I'm always down for trying out new sushi places, so we came here on a Monday night. This restaurant is fairly small but nice enough. The all you can eat is about $18.99 for dinner (I think its around $11.99 for lunch). I ended up ordering a green salad, a few salmon sashimi and one tuna (or something...), we got an order of spicy crunchy tuna rolls, a dragon roll, and teriyaki chicken.\n\nMy green salad came first and it was not what I was expecting. At almost all the other japanese restaurants I've been to, the green salad has this tasty yummy orange dressing. This one had some weird mayonnaise based dressing. Halfway through the salad I had to push it away because it was such a gross taste. My sashimi came next and it was okay. Definitely not the same grade of sashimi as I've found at other sushi places, but still good. The soy sauce though, seemed to be watered down. Quite a lot in fact.\n\nThe spicy crunchy tuna rolls were quite good (although falling apart), but the dragon roll fell a little flat for me. It was too big of a roll (almost falling apart when I tried to pick it up with chopsticks) and hard to fit in my mouth in one bite. The teriyaki chicken was quite good as well. We also got two pieces of the roll of the day, a hawaii roll, which was okay but nothing to write home about.\n\nMy main reason for giving this place a fairly low rating is due to the sloppy rolls. In a sushi restaurant the rolls should be well done but every single roll we got was falling apart as I ate it. If I can't pick up the roll and tip it in soy sauce and get it to my mouth in one piece, we have a problem. I could barely fit the dragon roll in my mouth and nothing really stood out as great.\n\nOverall, this was a mediocre dining experience for me and I won't be back. Nothing was good enough to bring me back for a second time, and while the service was great (two pieces of free roll, an orange for my friend's baby and a toy for her to play with) it just didn't cut it. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews here, you can get better sushi if you're willing to travel for it.
i have eaten in a few vintage inns over the years. the menu and service has got better and better. it is well worth the money and very frendly.
Went this past weekend with BF for lunch. I had the garlic pesto turkey sandwich, and he had the reuben. We both had the combo with soup of the day, which was french onion. The sandwiches were great! Asked them to heat our sandwiches and they were very tasty. Bread was fresh, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. Soup, on the other hand, was a little different. When dipping the bread in it, it seemed just as good as any other french onion soup, but upon spooning it up, it was different. Very strange.  Very good meal for a great price, I think we paid around $8.99 for each combo and we had the regular size sandwich. They also offer small and large. We will be back, and since I live around the corner, will be ordering lunch on my breaks when I feel like eating out. (I work from home).
I came here for dinner and I was disappointed.\n\nService was good initially, but as the food arrived the servers  disappeared. Perhaps because we got the corner table, they couldn't see us, but I had to get off my chair find someone to get the bill. Our tea was not refilled frequently enough either.\n\nAs for the food itself, it's similar to other places that I've been to. Our goal of the night was to have Peking Duck... it was good. I can't complain about the size of the duck. It was barely enough for everyone to have 2 servings. There is always a disproportionate amount of wraps to duck ratio... by the time we ordered more wrap, the remainder duck were already devoured since everyone was hungry.\n\nSweet and sour pork dish was disappointing. The pork was over fried.\n5 Style Vegetable with Bamboo fungus was pretty good. Not too salty.\n\nOverall I found the price quite expensive for the quality of food I got. I almost felt like they treated my friends and I as foreigners who never had traditional Chinese food before. I was quite disappointed.\n\nP.S. I found this coupon for Peking Duck if you are still interested in trying it out... I only found this after the fact (http://www.dine.to/daily_specials_popup.php?RecordID=329&id=3126)
It breaks my heart to say this but Ambassador is running on \"fumes\" and its past glory.  For a higher end Chinese restaurant, the service and quality just isn't there on my recent visit.  We all know everything has gone up in price over last few years but if someone drops $50-70 a head here, how do you justify it when nothing stands out vs the moderate family oriented places all over Markham?  My biggest issue:  a typical 10 course dinner averaging $55/person should have a devoted attendee to serve out the dishes instead of everything being self serve.  Am I missing something?  It was not even a busy night when I visited w/ a big party.  Golden Court next door can still deliver overall and charges about same.   When I first started visiting Toronto 11 yrs ago, this was one of the impressive places then, very professional service and food quality that was 2-3 cuts above the typical.
Run don't walk to this hidden gem on E. Charleston. We were in the mood for seafood and found this place on the recommendations of other yelpers. The owner's son ( so sorry I forgot his name) welcomed us warmly and led us to our seats. \n\nWe let him know we are New Yorkers but now call Vegas home and love the independent mom and pop restaurants. He told us to close the menu and let him create a meal  based on what seafood we like. We started with the free salsa and chips that were better than any I have ever tasted with a powerful pepper Kick! \nI chose the ceviche topped on a corn tortilla while the hubby had loaded fresh oysters topped with ceviche. The taste was so fresh and amazing; my hubby was in heaven! The shrimp empanadas were stuffed with shrimp with a delicate thin dough. Perfect! \n\nFor the main entree I chose the half pineapple loaded with seafood and cheese. Euphoria! I loved every bite. Will order this again. Hubby had the whole red snapper served with rice and beans saut\u00e9 with onions and peppers. The spice was up there but he pulled through like a trooper! \n\nWe are already planning our next trip and can't wait to bring friends that appreciate authentic Mexican seafood. Can't wait to return!
The food is delicious and the service is superb. This was our first time here and we are returning once again during our visit to Las Vegas. My boyfriend had the aguachile tostadas and he loved them! They are hot (picante) so if you're a fan of hot and spicy food this is the platter for you! I had the burrito bandera...it has steak, chorizo and lots of goodies insidedrenched in delicious red and green sauce with guacamole! Don't miss out on Vegas hidden secret. Los mariscos are great!, The food is great and so is the service.
Im so happy my husband found this place! At first I was skeptical, the way he described it made me question this place. One day I was craving thai food so he found a reason to bring me here. I ordered green curry with eggplant, hubby ordered drunken noodles and my 7 yrs old son had the orange/lemon chicken which all of em were really really good! Service was lovely and we found out they deliver too! Definitely will come back!
WOOOOOWWWWWW! My friends and I were downtown and looking for a place to eat and thank God for Yelp! Off the bat the chips and salsa came out and that fresh homemade salsa was out of this world. I am literally still drooling from it. \n\nWe ordered the fish and shrimp ceviche and the empanadas for appetizers and were blown away. So fresh and just delicious. We then ordered the family sized molcajete which had chicken, steak, shrimp, chorizo, avocado, catcus, onions, so much and literally every single item was better than the next. My friends and I cannot wait to go back again. I had my leftovers the morning after and it was still so ridiculously good. \n\nThe waiter (i didnt get his name) was super friendly, joked with us, recommended food, told us how big the portions were so we could order correctly (which we didn't listen to but he tried). We had a bunch of kids with us and he even put the television back on and put Harry Potter on for them. \n\nIt is not in the best area but do not let that stop you, the food is legit. \n\nI'm looking forward to my next trip there!
Stopped in today for some BBQ. Yum!!! I'm a southern girl and know good BBQ. These guys know their stuff. Tried the ribs and pork shoulder. Excellent. And the fried okra, collard greens and sweet potato pie were awesome. The folks that work there are friendly as all get out and you'll feel right at home. Food was ready in a jiffy. You'll smell the smokin' BBQ long before you reach the restaurant! Highly recommend.
Good food food the price. Tried the Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers...really recommend this sandwich. My lunch guest had their Chicago dog and said it was better than what you would get at the ballpark. The meal came with fries and a drink. I will definitely be back again.
Super nice people and good food! Wish the hours were better but the gyros are fantastic
I've been to a couple of restaurants in Mahomet, and this is by far the best one I've been to. Free chips and salsa is always nice, and all of the items I've tried so far have been delicious. I'll definitely be coming back here again!
This restaurant is bizarre. Its inside a business building, but there is a \"patio\" where you can side on the sidewalk if you want to. The decor is drab, but at least its very clean. It seems like it caters only to the business men who work in the building. The waitress was very sweet, but I felt very badly for her because she was being harassed by a table of drunk men. The owner (?) did NOTHING to stop it. We were the only table eating inside besides said drunkards. The salads we ordered were fresh and actually delicious. Nothing special, but good. Over all I would 100% skip this place. Its not worth it. The atmosphere is cheap sports bar trying to be classy. It had more of a banquet space feel. On the way out one of the drunk men mocked us and said lewd things. Not amused. I gave two stars because the salads were edible and fresh and the adorable waitress did nothing wrong. PS don't let the website fool you like it did us . . .
We went to Bobby C's last Sunday after a busy weekend full of activities and were instantly treated like family. Our fried chicken and country fried steak dinners were excellent as was the service. I highly recommend Bobby C's.
They do not actually make beer.  They only ferment wort.\n\nI had the ribeye, which was not seasoned at all, and was a very poor cut of meat.  It was cooked by someone who has no idea what a good steak is. The beer is not that good, the Duke being their best example.\n\nThe service was excellent, but does not make up for the lousy food and lousy beer.\n\nGranite city beer taste results:\nNorthern:  Warm water with a hint of beer.\nBennie:  Well balanced lager, caramel notes, watered down.\nTwo Pull:  Watered down Bennie.\nKolsh:  Sour, sharp hops, yeasty\nBelgian: bitter, lacking malt taste, salty aftertaste, probably a bad batch die to lack of sanitation.\nDuke:  Sierra Nevada clone with a bit more hop characteristic.  Cascade hops. Not too heavy.  Excellent beer.
Great spot to grab cocktails and some Haitian small plates. Lively, hip atmosphere that makes a great addition to the trio owned by black hoof and cocktail bar folks.
Super small place but the food is amazing. The horchata is homemade and it was my favorite. Aguachiles are a must. Expect a wait time but it's well worth it.
We were craving Mexican food for dinner and didn't want commercial restaurant. Thank you Yelp for helping us find this \"hole in the wall\" amazing gem!! \nIt's a family run joint, with a welcoming decor and equally entertaining staff. Our server was the owner's son who shared with us some fun background about the restaurant and some great dishes. In addition for locals to stay away during peak tourist hours... Apparently our visit happened during a rare time of near empty. \nDon't pass this place up!! \nWe will be back.
My husband and I came for Marketlicious and we got to choose three tapas each plus a dessert for $25. The highlights were the crispy bass, pork belly and manchego churros! The churros was light and crispy.bit was served with Barsa ketchup which was lighter than the regular thing. The bass was nice and flavourful. The pork belly was rich and the grits that came with it was very nice. \nThe service was very attentive and nice. All in all I would come back to this restaurant.
Plein de saveurs de saucisses pour sortir des saveurs traditionnelles! \nIl existe plusieurs sortes de viande: agneau, porc, poulet, etc. \nQue vous soyez plut?t sucr\u00e9s ou non: mangue, canneberge, \u00e9pinards, \u00e0 la bi\u00e8re, etc. Un vrai r\u00e9gal pour les papilles garanti!
Love that we have a Cheeba Hut in the hood!! Very friendly customer service and both times I've been my sandwich was just as expected!!  I've been frequenting the Mesa location for over a decade so it's nice to have one so close to home.  Good selection of craft beers at the bar, looks like Friday is all day happy hour at $3 a glass for craft, not to bad at all.  Don't forget to try the munchies!! I tried the Cap'n Crunch bar, wowsers! Can't wait to come back to get a Blunt of Chronic :-)\n\n\nEdit 6/14/17\nTried to call in a take out order like I've done over a dozen times at 11:30 and was told \"no take out orders after 11:30\"  I live in the neighborhood and usually order on the phone and pick it up in 10 minutes later.  Pretty lame, no more Cheeba Hut ever again for late night eats, Welcome Diner it is.
Our meal was simply stunning. The service was top-notch, not that I expected anything less. The 3-piece meat taster ($145) is highly recommended. The steamed chard was the best I've ever had -- the garlic didn't overwhelm the dish, which often happens. The other side, the mac and cheese, complemented the meal nicely, but really, the meats were the stars of the meals and well-worth every cent of their $145 price tag. This was the sort of meal that made me pity vegetarians.
Yes, yea, everything yes. Make sure you sit at the bar, they bring you this delicious little try of fresh baked (maybe?) breads - pretzel, focaccia, and some others. The pretzel bread is out of this world. I can still taste it. (Great, now I'm drooling...)\n\nThe bartenders are friendly and the pours aren't skimpy. The wine-by-the-glass list has a couple nice options and make for great pairings with the appetizer list. \n\nThe tuna tartare is great - I've only ever eaten at the bar and had appies and wine, but I'll definitely be back to check out their entrees and cocktails.
Okay. I consider myself a lover of all food, someone who has had a taste of everything here and there. And while I think that I've had the best of the best, and the worst of the worst, I must say that after all my years on this earth I feel like I have wasted them all until I ate at CUT. \n\nI'm exaggerating, yes. But you know what? One bite of a steak at CUT tasted like heaven. Here I was, lalala-ing about how I've had so much good food in my life, and then one bite of a petit (haha) NY strip steak made me want to jump out of my seat and sing from the rooftops and fields in Europe. Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!\n\nI guess I've been selling myself short... I've never had a dry aged steak before. I never thought steak would taste so good, let alone without soy sauce (filipino thing). It was grilled on some wood grill and then fired in a billion degree oven with all these spices. Ahh, yes. And the peppercorn sauce that I got along with it? DELIGHTFUL. HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. The side dishes: fingerling potatoes with bacon confit and caramelized pearl onions, mac n cheese, sauteed spinach, creamed spinach... all very good too. My cousin and I indulged in that yummy bone marrow flan... all delightfully good. The side dishes may not have been a good idea, as it was a struggle to even finish my steak. But I finished it. If my steak was $55 dollars, all of it better be in my stomach by the end of the night.\n\nI don't exaggerate the greatness of CUT... the next night I found myself at a restaurant back home in SF and I pretty much ordered the same thing: steak, sides, etc. Once I took a bite and swallowed that piece of meat, I sighed. CUT basically ruined steak for me. Not that the steak that I was having at the time wasn't good, it's just that it didn't have the same juiciness and tenderness of the previous steak. It made me question my eating habits, the way I choose my food, the way I live my life. Ugh, it was so delicious. I need to come back here.
Let me start my review off by saying that my husband and I really enjoy the food here, and have been coming since they first opened.  But the service is just beyond terrible, literally getting worse each time we come.  Last time I went the guy making my salad knocked over the salad container and attempted to picked it all up, even stuff that fell on the floor until I called him out on it. I was baffled.  My husband has a shellfish allergy, and they do have shrimp on the toppings bar, so we notified them immediately.  Yet the cashier in no way notifies the person making the salad, so saying something is worthless   Not to mention dirty tables and trash everywhere.  They're obviously too busy for the unexperienced, young workers to handle   They really need to step it up. We should really stop going, but the salads are so good!
Small portions, and stingy on the toppings. I would rather go to chipotle or burrito boyz across the street.
Ordered the moo goo pai chicken. Wait time was very quick but it was very bland and customer service was poor also. Older lady with a thick accent took my order and since I couldnt understand her entirely she got rude. Would never come back
This is the closest location to my place of employment, so I come here most days.  They're a great bunch of women, lead by a competent and professional manager, who's name I unfortunately didn't catch.  Whenever I'm there, she's involved and quick to get your order prepared, sans problems.  Although the line-up in drive-thru is usually long, the manager (who has no problems jumping on the headset and taking the orders), is quick to clear the line.   I really wish I'd caught her name because I'd love to give her the kudos she so deserves.  So, to the nameless lady-manager-wonderwoman, you have succeeded in making my lunches spectacular :)\n\nP.S.  you should carry my soup more often!! (Hearty Potato Bacon..yummy)
Food was OK.  Staff working was nice.  We were the only people in the restaurant at 5:30 pm.   We used a Go Play and Save coupon........sandwiches come with a side unless you use a coupon.  If you use a coupon you are charged extra for the side. Staff called someone,  the owner or manager and she stated the additional charge applied although the side is included with the sandwich.  What a ripoff!!! Did not seem to care if we complain..... so here is your complaint Jack's New Yorker Deli, for all to see..  No worries we will not go back.
Awesome food truck I highly recommend for graduation parties I hired them for my wedding on New Year's Eve and my gas still talk about the hamburgers!
Good was pretty good  \nService was slow\nBathrooms smelled of urine.  I told the host of the condition of the bathrooms. He looked at me like I was speaking Navajo.
Great Honduran restaurant with a menu catered to less adventurous diners who consider fajitas \"branching out\". I recommend picking out a handful of house specialty apps and an entree or two to split it with friends. You can't beat leaving with full bellies, to-go boxes, and an average of ten bucks a person. \n\nI'm one of those less adventurous eaters who tried fajitas the first time I dropped in. They were good, but pretty greasy--even for fajitas. So, my boyfriend convinced me to return and let him order. Now, the Choripollo will be something I'll be craving again before long (see photo). I give it 4 out of 5 stars only because their Mexican is half of the menu but not their calling. \n\nMake sure you check out Las Delicias across the street for chocolate cake or their chocolate mice with almond slivers for ears (they taste like Swiss Rolls).
Te gustan los bodegones? Te gustan los clubes barriales? Te gusta la comida \u00e9tnica? Este lugar tiene todo de eso.\n\nEl Club Hungaria, como su nombre lo indica, es un club ubicado en el barrio de Olivos, casi Mart\u00ednez, con aires de bodeg\u00f3n y especializados en comida h\u00fangara.\n\nDe las mejores opciones que hay en el barrio (si es que no es la mejor): Buenos precios, platos abundantes y comida como la de la abuela.\n\nObviamente, lo m\u00e1s recomendado es el Goulash (de carne, de cerdo o mixto).\nSi te queda lugar (porque los platos son MUY grandes), tambi\u00e9n hay ricos postres.\n\nLos precios? Muy buenos.\n\nLa ambientaci\u00f3n es bien antigua, de club viejo; pero va muy acorde con el lugar.\n\nSi bien el sal\u00f3n es bastante amplio (y a veces abren el sal\u00f3n contiguo), es recomendable reservar, porque se llena.
There is another Chinese place closer to where I live that delivers, and I would still rather drive to Chef Chens and pick up dinner.  The people are always nice and friendly. The food is always done quickly and it's always good.
I absolutely love this place!!! The wings are amazing, the staff is awesome and the price for any food item is reasonable. Definitely one of my top places for wings. I always try the 6 wings and pizza slice combo with a drink for only $6 and some change. How awesome is that!!?? Me and my boyfriend love this place and always come down when I don't feel like cooking.
Time went: August 23, 2010 Monday 3:30 AM\n\nDon't and I repeat, DO NOT ever go here!\n\nUnless you love:\n-Ridiculously slow service\n-Crappy staff\n-Overpriced food\n\nYes, we are in Vegas, everything is overpriced, but the food here are like Denny's and iHop, but with a lot less variety.\nWe went here because it was the only thing open in the hotel and we were dead tired with walking, so we settled at the Coffee Shop.\nFirst thing I noticed, there were 1 group of 3 in line waiting, but there were 4 staffs talking to each other by the cash register while 2 servers walking around getting stuff, and TONS of open tables. But we got in about 5 minutes. We sat and 1 minute later the waitress came and asked if we want anything to drink. We got water and was still looking at the menu so we left it at that. We waited for 15 minutes, but no water and no service. There were now 6 staffs talking at the cash register and the waitress just passed us by twice without looking at us. I tried to flag any staff down, but no one came, so we just left. When we left the staffs by the cash register looked at us with mean look.\n\nWe went to the convenience store in TI instead to get beef jerky water and chips.
After seeing the horrendously expensive restaurants at Mandalay Bay, we came here to have an affordable dinner. Not only was it adorable, but the quality of the food was very good. There was a wide selection of Vietnamese pho, staple foods, and rice plates in terms of the Pho side. For the American side of food, hamburgers, taco salad, and breakfast foods dominated the menu and from the look of other tables in the restaurant, people were enjoying everything. \n\nThe service was fast, friendly, and efficient. If you're looking for a good value and a good selection, I highly recommend this place!
over priced for sure. Checked out at T.I - came here for bfast before the road and it was blah- my dad was raving about it as we waited but it was just eh....\n\ni ordered the Fresh Market Skillet- eh- it came with soggy hash browns and eggs that i could totally tell where powdered - kinda disappointing - wasnt salted.. i mean blah
Food is so yummy! Service is pretty good! The music selection is random. They were playing Latin music, not what I expected from a middle eastern restaurant!
Went to the Keg on York yesterday after work with friends. Got there around 4:45 and had no trouble getting a table for four. As usual at this location, everything was superb.  Service was prompt and food was delicious! You can't go wrong with the Keg Classics.  I started with a wedge salad in blue cheese dressing - so so yummy - and had the teriyaki steak which came mushrooms, red peppers and I got the loaded baked potato.  This is a large meal so I took half home and had the rest for lunch today! Hubby always orders the oscar steak which is covered in fresh shrimp and scallops in a bearnaise sauce. I had a taste of my friend's dessert - Billy Miner's pie... a large slice of heaven. Love the Keg and will continue to make this an after work destination.
People... stop complaining about how people are dressed and let's talk Steak which is what this place is all about. The 20oz ribeye is a must try and definitely the best one I have ever had. Chicago style is just perfect in my opinion as it adds some char flavor without losing the juiciness! Fantastic service and very competitive price. Forget Ruth's Chris, come here instead for a perfect steak experience. The mocha ice cream dessert is a perfect finish!
Wow. I came here at 3 am because I was hungry. the bartender, Ricky, threw the menu at me, gave me the ultimatum when i ordered wings. The worst service i have ever seen! Not only that, I left him tip on the table, and he came by and made a sarcastic comment about it. He was lucky i even left him a tip! Seriously the worst PTs I have ever been to: and I am born and raised here. I should know.
We went for the lunch buffet & came back to work stuffed & happy. It was spicy, full of flavor & delicious. Next time, I'm trying the chicken tikka...
I've been coming to this location for a long time even before the renovated. Taste here is constant and is always delicious. I'm one of the people that always get the house special which is far from bad. Would recommend people to come if your looking for a viet restaurant in the area
It's a chain, so if you've been to one you've been to them all. This one in particular involves a higher than usual wait time is the only thing that would differentiate it from other Rubio's. If you are familiar with Rubio's don't read on: it's a good one, though you have to wait for it. If you haven't been to Rubio's read on.\n\nForget everything you think you know about chains, Rubio's defies every myth. These are the bomb-diggity of the fish taco market. I'm serious, if you're eating fish tacos at a taco truck right now becaue you think coming to Rubio's isn't \"authentic\" or \"selling out\" you're missing out. I love taco trucks in Arizona, my favorite Mexican restaurant in the world is a taco truck in Tucson (Nene's), but for fish tacos I will say that I have yet to come across one that I would take over Rubio's-- honestly.\n\nThese babies are fresh, they're flavorful, and no they're not del taco price, but they're not breaking the bank either. On a budget? Just get a burrito, same fish tacoey goodness in a titan-sized package. Their salsas taste like the real deal, I recommedn the tomatillo, but try them all. I prefer flour tortillas, but the corn is good here. Unlike your taco trucks, you have choices, and the best news? They're all good choices. \n\nStill skeptical? Come on a Tuesday, try them for just 1.50 each, and thank me later when you're coming back here on a Wednesday just because. \n\nAnd yes, all this from a chain!
I stopped by this location tonight to pick up dinner for someone and they were surprisingly nice. Normally in the drive through they are sneaking \"meows\" in or other teenage jokes. Although annoying, it is not enough to stop me from going to the convenient location 3 minutes from my house. Tonight was a different story. While eating the bean burrito I picked up, the person stopped chewing and I asked what was wrong, assuming the messed up again and put onion in his no onion bean burrito. When he finally put his fingers up to his lips and pulled out a piece of metal from his mouth I was shocked. He immediately threw the other food away, which was over half of everything I had picked up. I am thankful that he felt the metal before he swallowed it. I didn't even bother going up to complain because the location is run by immature 16 year olds who would have laughed it off and given me a new burrito.
Walked in to find employees sitting around a table eating lunch. While waiting for our appetizers, I noticed a burnt oil smell coming from the kitchen.  When our tofu satay came out, we stared at it in surprise.  The 6 little tofu strips were grayish/white and soggy with oil and with black bits of old fryer oil scraps attached to them.  There was absolutely no taste to the tofu at all (apart from the oil).  Later I realized the cucumber salad listed on the menu wasn't included. When the main entree arrived, my boyfriend received his meal but I was told my meal took a long time to make and would be done soon and although I had asked for no onions due to food allergies, my pho included big onion pieces when it did arrive.  They offered to remake my food but my boyfriend had already received his food and I didn't want to wait, not to mention I was still disgusted by the bad impression given by the appetizer. The waitress did give use a coupon for a buy one get one free meal in the future, but at this point that really isn't something that will be getting used. I ended up paying over $20 for one lunch and one appetizer... totally not worth it.
Pleasantly surprised. \n\nBeen here twice, and my only complaint is that the bill can add up quickly. \n\nThe first time we ordered pizza, wings, and beer. Can't remember which kind of each of these things we got, but I know I thought it was good, and that I was sad it wasn't a little cheaper so we could go more often (I am a cheapskate..). Also we got the giant cookie dessert.\n\nThe second time we went, I got the house chardonnay (meh...) and the baked ziti with meatballs, the man got the chicken parmesan. I think he has made it his personal duty to all italian restaurants ever to eat chicken parmesan, to be able to compare them ALL one day. \n\nAnyways, our slightly over-zealous waitress brings the food out, and its HUUUUUGE!!! I think each of our plates could have fed 3 people. I was glad we didn't get salads or appetizers. He quite enjoyed the chicken, and my ziti was smothered in this awesome red/white (bechemel?) sauce mixture with mozarella on top and 3 little garlic knots. I picked most of the mozarella off (trying to diet on italian food? Doesn't work too well.....) but i tried nonetheless :) . I boxed up over half of it, and his leftovers heated up well the next night for dinner. \n\nTo top it off, we had another serving of the giant cookie. This put me over the edge and it was definitely an i-ate-too-much kind of an evening! So basically the only downside is that each time, with just the two of us, the bill reached somewhere around $50. Granted we were drinking, but still........\n\nOverall, its not the place to go if you want something super fancy (although there was a little prom couple there...) ... but for moderately priced, fairly good food it works!
I took my boyfriend here for a birthday treat last summer, booked online with a request to put a candle on whatever desert he ordered. He thoroughly enjoyed the food (we both had steaks). It is quite noisy, but that's expected in a brasserie. The food was so good, you can tell it's a Martin Wishart restaurant. Even though we only had steak, chips & greens, I could not fault the food. Also my boyfriend asked for sorbet by itself for desert which wasn't a problem (it wasn't on the menu) - it came with a candle as requested! The wine list was good too, think I tried two different reds (they had a nice selection of wines by the glass), the sommelier recommended a few wines too. \n\nI love this place and will visit again with a larger group of friends (I can't remember much else but I know the food was lovely)
Oh The Honours, you set the bar high for our first meal in Edinburgh. I can see why you're named one of the best and must eats when in Scotland, especially for steak. Reservation in hand, my boyfriend and I showed up once the restaurant opened, famished as we had just flown in from London. Truth be told, you actually don't need a reservation as the venue is extremely spacious and can definitely accommodate plenty. \n\nAs I'm indecisive and always wish to sample as much as possible, I opted for the 2 course prix fixe - the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the braised short rib for my entree. The boyfriend had the Picanha steak with a red wine sauce. Upon ordering, the waiter informed me that the smoked salmon is cut in thick rectangles, something I'm not used to as the smoked salmon I've always had was sliced thin, but I loved the texture that it provided. The capers as a garnish meshed well with the salmon as well. I couldn't help, but rave with each bite. Meal started off right! The short rib and steak came next. My short rib actually came with a free side of \"mashed\" potatoes, but it actually was more like pur\u00e9ed potatoes as it was super watery, but nonetheless, flavorful and delicious. My initial bite of the short rib was perfection -super tender that you didn't even need a knife and bursting with beefiness. Combined with the potatoes, it was a perfect bite. BUT then I had a piece of my boyfriend's steak and it completely made my dish seem awful. The steak was THAT good! And I'm not even a steak fan! That steak was tender and had the perfect amount of fat, but what made it was its natural juices. So good that I took all the bread from the bread basket and sopped it all up. Yes, you will have no shame when you have steak here. I wish I had ordered a steak for myself! FYI - if order the steak, it's only for steak, so if you want a side, you'll have to order that separately. Also, order the steak medium - if you say anything other than medium, you will be looked upon with fear. \n\nWith its Michelin star, let's not forget about the service here. Our waiter and servers were SO polite and explained everything well. I stepped away to use the restroom and bumped into the server, who looked concerned that I was going to the restroom when he was holding my appetizer to serve to me. To sum it up, everything about the Honours was amazing - definitely make this your first or last meal when you're in Edinburgh (they also have a location in Glasgow)!
I have pretty much eaten everything in their menu!! Everything is amazing!!! Great margaritas! Best fried rice around!! Bus boy special is always fresh from West Side Market! \n\nCan't beat their $1 tacos in Tuesday's!
My husband and I have been coming to Isabella's since it opened a few years ago. We have always had great food, great service, and a great time. Our experience last night prompted me to finally write a review. \n\rWe typically order a delicious pizza to go, after we enjoy a cocktail and enthusiastic conversation with the best bartender, Jim, aka Petey, and best manager, Nate. Last night's experience did not disappoint. Between the lively banter and laughter, they are also focused on making sure each person at the bar or in the restaurant has a fresh cocktail and attentive service. \n\rLast night, we decided to change things up and eat at the bar.   My husband ordered Spaghetti & Meatballs, while I had Deb's Pasta. The handcut pastas were amazing. The texture was perfect, and the sauces did not take away from the freshness of the pasta. You could taste all the fresh herbs in the roasted tomato sauce, and the meatballs were savory with just the right amount of spice. With Deb's Pasta, the melted Parmesan and tomatoes were the perfect compliment to the grilled chicken and spaghetti. \n\rI cannot say enough about the fantastic meal and fabulous experience. You will never be disappointed at Isabella's.
Honestly, I am not sure what is so great about this place. \n\nOverall the food is very bland, which is on par for restaurants in this part of Toronto. \n\nWe ordered the shakshouka. The shakshouka tasted like chili with eggs that I could have made at home. The pita was ok. \n\nThe eggs and lax was marginally better but still bland overall. The bagels were ok but they only gave you butter and jam to put on it, would have been better with some cream cheese. \n\nIts nice that you get quick service on the coffee, but the coffee is also flavorless. \n\nThe place seems packed, so people must like it, but we left underwhelmed. \n\nOne positive sit that the seating inside is nice and they have free parking in the mall complex that they are located in.
Excellent food, great service, convenient location.  Will return when I'm back in Cleveland.  Thx.
I gave this place a 1 star because a zero rating was not an option. The pizza tasted like it came out of the microwave, they must use imitation cheese. \n\nIf McDonald's served pizza it would taste exactly like this! Very surprised this place is still doing business, and serving this nonsense to the public.\n\nBrunos is to pizza what Taco Bell is to Mexican Food.
I am a huge fan of Indian food, I have never found a place in Arizona even close to the Indian food I can get back home in London. That being said, the food at India grill was tasty, I had the chicken korma which tasted good, not what I'm used to for a korma but it was nice. The garlic naan was yumsville. The employees were very nice and attentive and our server even split our desserts for us having heard us talk about sharing all in all a great experience
This restaurant is what I like to call the \"maestro of All Asian Legends\". This restaurant really defines itself as a top restaurant in North York and demonstrating what Shanghai food is. I have been going to this restaurant for 2 years and it never seems to have any major flaws. The food here is authentic and always proportioned welled. The flavors are amazing and remind me of China. The food comes out quick and hot. Also, the servers are great and are always welcoming. They are responsive and always happy to take your order. Along with the great food , the restaurant decor feels amazing and looks like a true restaurant. I recommend this restaurant to everyone. This restaurant deserves my 5 out of 5 stars.
I've been to at least four other Asian Legend locations and this is probably the worst one for their braised beef noodle soup.  I thought that the quality would remain the same since it is a chain, but it's almost night and day compared with the one in say...Scarborough! The noodles they use are also different and flat (although that's just a preference I guess..but they don't seem to be traditional Shanghai noodles). The soup was also not as flavourful.  The potstickers were also smaller and they sometimes forget to give you vinegar for dipping. I've ordered takeout from here multiple times but I'm almost tempted to travel a bit further to another Asian Legend to get better quality food.
Great pizza! We ordered the\"Butcher.\" Bartender was S L O W! Very focused on what, we still don't know! Doesn't look like they could multi task! Definitely come back for the food, but I'd sit at a table NOT the bar! We were even drinking Macallan Scotch! We call our experience, the \"Hunger Games!\"
We live near this bar/restaurant and frequent it.  As a vegetarian, I love that they offer a portobella \"burger\" and other veggie friendly appetizers. They have a lot of great beer on tap and it rotates seasonally. All of the servers we have had have been knowledgeable about whats on tap and willing to offer suggestions. My husband and I always go there during the week. The crowd weekday nights is pretty mellow (unless a game is on!) I don't know how the weekends are. It's a great place to watch a game too, as there are tv screens all around the the bar. \nI also wanted to give them a big THANKS to the Saloon. During the big snow snowstorm of 2010, our power went out and the staff at the Saloon let us spend a long time eating dinner, and hanging out while we waited of our electricity to come back on.
Very good food and beer selection. We have ate here twice now because it is one of the few places in PGH that have Buffalo chicken dip which is our favorite. Theirs is very good. So thank you for that! The chicken cheesesteak was AMAZING. Wings & pretzel appetizer are yummy too. They also give you popcorn when you sit down which I think is a nice touch. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the atmosphere. When we walked in it smelt SO badly of stale beer. I know it's a bar, but it was pretty bad. It was a Sunday though so they were probably super busy Saturday night. We will definitely be returning for food and drinks!
This Chandler and Alma School location never fails to surprise. I like Filiberto's but this place seems a bit pricier than some of the others and they ALWAYS skimp on portions. You never know what you're gonna get as far as freshness and flavor goes. I have gone to the Elliot and Dobson one, many a times, just to avoid this Filiberto's and I live in walking distance! I always tell myself never to come back but I must say I am guilty But only after a late night of working and don't feel like driving far and getting out of my car. I really shouldn't be surprised...\n\n***Da Bafroom: I have only been inside this location once, a long time ago, and did not visit the bathroom. Shame on me, yes I know! But being that it's one of the newest Fili-B's, I would imagine it being a fairly clean and ordinary bathroom. May need to make one more stop someday to update this portion of my review. To be continued...
Don't go here!!! Service is slow, food isn't that good and it's very expensive. There are way better restaurants on the strip for the same price. I live out side of San Francisco and have eaten at many fine restaurants. This place is on the avoid list. The only thing I liked was the pop over, the drinks are gross! For a 14 dollar mixed drink it should have been shaken and then served on the rocks. My steak was cooked to how I wanted it but it wasn't impressive it was still a little a tough and was drenched in butter that's it very boring place very boring food. Go to Gordon Ramsey steak at Paris. Food service ambiance is better. The manager at this place is a slim ball. He needs to work at McDonald's. Not worth the time either 3 people no desserts and it took 2.5 hours to get through dinner never again and I want others to not make this mistake!
Fantastic food. Hot fresh and delicious.  This is the place for some good bbq. I love this place.
Understated, no-frills kind of place, but REALLY good BBQ. Their brisket is melt-in-your-mouth delicious!
A lot smaller than the LA location. But who cares!! I'm not here because of how big the restaurant is or the color of the dining room walls or carpet. I'm here for Steak... Delicious, Tender and Flavorful beef. \n\nFirst we start off with some complimentary Foie mousse.. Foie being legal so it's nice being in LV and not LA. \n\nThen you get this amazing Gruyere popover. I crave this popover!! \n\nI order the Shellfish tower for one which includes: \nHalf Lobster, crab leg, 3 oysters, 3 clams, 2 prawns. Perfect little App before my meal. \n\nI ordered the Bone-in Ribeye that comes with bone marrow, roasted garlic and herb butter. This steak is flavorful, juicy, and exactly what you expect to taste. I must say the crust!! That crust!!! You just can't get this crust anywhere!! I've eaten everywhere. Craft, Cut, STK, Masteros. No where!! \nNever been to Peter Lugers, but that's next.
I'm always at a loss for inexpensive places to eat in the Yorkville area. While there seem to be lots and lots of restaurants, I never have any idea of which ones are worthy of my high-falutin' taste buds. I am so happy my friend suggested we go to The New Yorker Deli before we saw 'I Am Love' across the street (my Reuben sandwich turned out to be better than the movie, BTW).\n\nAt first glance, this deli really looks like it could be a genuine New York haunt, replete with tile floors and retro booths and tables. Our waitress was reminiscent of a New Yorker as well, with a dose of good ol' Toronto hospitality thrown in for good measure. She took lots of time to help us navigate our way through the huge menu and explain several dishes. Lovely woman, a spitfire really.\n\nI ended up going with the Rueben combo (+fries and coleslaw), as previously mentioned. And it was DEE-lish--salty meat, tangy sauerkraut and a big side of homemade thousand islands dressing! My total was about $15, and it was worth every penny (although I wouldn't exactly complain if it was lower). I'm relatively new to the world of smoked meats, but I'd have to say this place lived up to my expectation of what a prime example should taste like. I'm looking forward to trying other combos!!\n\nMy friend ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese and peameal bacon that was so big I couldn't believe he finished it... must have been really good. Cause it truly was epic.\n\nAll in all, this was a great experience. Partly because the food was great, but also because I'm glad I now know it exists.
Vernors ginger ale, tables full of mustard, and matzo ball soup. Three important ingredients in a great deli, and The New Yorker Deli has 'em all. \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty sterile, with some pseudo-celebrity headshots on the wall. This won't impress most folks, but it really makes me incredibly cozy and happy. The old dudes serving up the corned beef sandwiches, pickles and other treats are great fellas, and I've never been disappointed. I'm especially in love with their matzo ball soup, complete with carrot hunks and extra salty broth. Slurp!
By far the worst deli I've been to in Toronto. The decor is nice, but that's about it. I ordered 1lb of pastrami only to have to spend time at home cutting off the fat that made up for half of every piece. Total rip off and parking is a pain to find. Clearly, they don't have a clue as to how to serve the meat properly. There was also what looked like a pig ear just laying around on the cutting table. Very unprofessional. As for the pastrami itself, it was sub-par at best.
The pizza was just ok. The staff seemed nice but were all young didn't seem like any manager was there keeping them in check. They were on their phones, playing around, hanging out all while literally half the tables in the building were covered in dirty dishes. The floor was covered in trash from one side to the other. The bathroom was like a shady has station bathroom smelled nice but looked disgusting. You need someone on duty at all times to keep this place in check I would be embarrassed if I owned this location and walked in and saw it the way customers see it. We were there for over an hour, not one dirty table was bussed. The one table we found that had no dishes had ripped up booths . a few fresh pizzas came out not all that I've seen at better locations.
I have been going here for about a year now, and it has become the Saturday afternoon hang out.  The best thing about this place is their beer selection.  They keep well over 100 different beers tap/bottle at all times.  If you enjoy trying new beers then look no further this place is for you, so join the club.  The food is decent, and what you would expect from a place like this, burgers, sandwiches, apps, ect.  The atmosphere is awesome and you will not be disappointed.  They try and have different events at least once a month which is nice if you are a regular it keeps things interesting.  The staff is very kind and always knows exactly what my wife wants to eat and drink.  The one thing I am disappointed in is their \"health score\" and I hope they bring it up.
Really had fun. The food is great and the staff are really nice and attentive. The selection of beer is just crazy large and staff is fairly knowledgable about the beer and can even make great recommendations.
Having been to my first Flying Saucer via Houston I just had to see if Charlotte's location could meet or exceed that one.  \n\nI noticed the moment I walked in that the interior is acutally a little smaller but decorated almost identically.  Plates on the ceilings, booths along the wall and large sofa and chairs for lounging.  I really want to come back and just sit in those chairs and drink some cold beverages.\n\nThe food is a little better than bar food, although my girlfriend was a bit robbed when it comes to value of her roast beef sandwich she ordered.  Personally I love the rocket tots and the space club I got was delicious.\n\nNow for the most important part the beer.  Yes, this place has tons of it and while I really wanted to take a run for getting my own plate on the wall, the location of this place is just too far from my house for me to really give it a go.
(Shhh, I'm trying to stay awake at work, so writing this review!) Last Saturday, out-of-town friends and I found ourselves in this neck of the woods for the first time to visit the monstrosity that is the sports arenas/shopping malls. (NEVER AGAIN!!!)\n\nMade our first mistake going to a Yelp approved Mexican joint that made us pay a cover charge to enter, that promised they'd have seating inside, but didn't.\n\nWe were hungry, so we were happy to find that this place had seating and was not crawling with drunken wrestling fans.  I was particularly thrilled with their milkshakes for $3.50!  My Bison Burger was HUGE (1/2 pounder), but I think I made a mistake and should have built more toppings into it, because it was overall a bit dry.  For you non Beef eaters, they also have salads\n\nOwner and Servers were friendly, and I liked the blue, clean ambiance.  It did it's job well!
I got the ham, spinach, and goat cheese crepes. They were delicious! The crepes are nicely balanced with a little bit of sweetness. My husband got the eggs Benedict with salmon and capers, with the mornay sauce, which he also enjoyed. Coffee comes with the meal, which is awesome. Great service too!
This place is more like a sports bar than anything. They got the game playing, tons of beers in bottles. And they got a pretty interest line up of beers on draft. I wanted to try their IPA, but they didn't have any more on draft. They substituted for another IPA, so all is well. They had a wheat beer that tasted like captain crunch(yes the cereal), that was kind of cool.
Sunday Brunch is extraordinary. Last Sunday, we had the buffet for $25 with a fabulous selection of choices from fresh sushi, pastries, desserts, fruits and on and on...even a press pot of coffee. We could have had many additional hot choices for $10 (a bargain) more, but didn't see the need. Loved it. Terrific service. Quiet. One of the best gourmet bargains we've found. the Frank Lloyd Wright designs shine through.
We just had an amazing meal. My husband and I had the tasting menu with wine pairing. Other than dessert we were each given a different course. All were amazing. John.  Our server was a delight. For those of you who live in the area, check them out. The value per dollar is great.
Ate here for a meeting. They had a pre fixe three course menu, each course of which included meat & dairy components. I'm a vegan, so requested that \"just a salad will be fine.\" I didn't expect much, because I am used to not receiving much in the way of vegan food, even from pretty nice restaurants.\n\nWright's served a full 3 course vegan meal that was absolutely delicious. I haven't had such a good set of vegan food in a long time, possibly ever. I only wish that I had more time to dedicate my full attention to the meal.\n\nGood starter salad (fairly basic) - good rolls - excellent succotash, really to die for - and an excellent dessert. Pretty sure they have a good wine list, the red that was served at the table was very good. Plus they served key lime flavored cotton candy as a freebie at the end, awesome.\n\nService was also great, despite that I was a bit gruff explaining that I am vegan. I would give more than 5 stars if I could.
Best thing about this place was definitely the service! From the girls up front to our waiter, just fantastic customer service. Everyone was super friendly, informative and greeted us with smiles. \n\nOur waiter, Duff, was an absolute pro. He knew that menu inside and out. He was able to give us great recommendations on the wine list and food menu. He made everything sound so delicious that we wanted to order the whole menu! Just a phenomenal job. \n\nNow for the food... They started us off with a little amuse Bouche. It was duck liver mousse with jelly. I don't like liver at all but I gave it a try and wow it was good. My favorite thing was the popovers they brought instead of your typical loaf of bread. The flavor and texture were great and they even give you a card with the recipe! Sharing is caring! \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 got the Caesar salad which was great. He got the NY strip steak which was huge and I got my go to Filet Mignon. The steak was good but not the best I've had. Good flavor but it was only warm not piping hot even though it was served on a cast iron plate. I ordered it medium rare and it was perfectly cooked. It paired nicely with their plump asparagus and delicious Mac & cheese. I guess I was a little disappointed in the steak, but everything else was great. Perhaps I'm a steak snob but when you've had some delicious steak you're always chasing the next best thing.
We tried to order online through ubereats, after spending the time trying to decide what to order, the order was rejected without explanation. Don't show yourself as open on ubereats if you aren't accept orders.
I've gone here for brunch on a couple of occasions. The service has always been great. I think I have been lucky enough to not have to wait. The food has always been yummy.. I ordered an omelette on both instances and both times they came out warm and cooked well. I recall that the portions were average. The home fries were yummy. I don't recall there being a lot of tea selection though.
The ambience is very warm with lots of wood and exposed brick, and dim lighting.  Music was mostly indie rock (Arcade Fire, Feist), not too loud but loud enough to hear it.  Our server for the evening was excellent, very friendly and helpful.   They don't take reservations, which wasn't a problem on a Sunday.  \n\nWe ordered a bunch of items to share and everything was tasty, although perhaps not mind-blowing.  The wine list is short, but contains a good range of choices to suit all preferences, and my dining companion indulged in some of the fancy cocktails they do, and said they were lovely.  \n\nOverall a great dining experience, and I will definitely be back.
People should be aware of the lack of sanitation and honesty that manifests in there.  Cafe St Germain is unprofessional, overpriced, and mediocre at best. You can see the owner pushing a no frills cart back and forth each day! I have no idea how the dump is still open.
Terrible service. Indifferent towards customers and attitude of workers can be improve. This place can do a much better job with the customers that they have.
Given that your a juice/smoothie fanatic, you'd spend the best part of a year gulping your way through Juice almighty's offerings.  \n\nThe 'Pink Drink' and 'Brain Buzz' are well-equipped to perk you up good and proper for the day ahead and for a reasonably price too.\n\nA daily stew is up for grabs too, alongside some wraps and soups.
My Girlfriend and i went here for a quick dinner, as I was taking off from the airport and we wanted to eat.  My review is based more on the food, than the service.  The customer service was good, they were a little quiet, but polite and courteous.  The food, in my opinion, could have been a little better prepared.\n\nMy girlfriend had chicken tacos and I had tacos Al Pastor, both were serviced with beans.  A side of chips also came with the orders.  My Girlfriend said her tacos's were good.  My Taco's Al Pastor seemed more of a breaded fry than a Al Pastor marinade.  They were very tough.\n\nThe beans were unusually white and creamy.  Not sure if they were instant or maybe to much oil/lard in the mix?\n\nThe salsa's weren't bad.\n\nWe also ordered two medium Horchata drinks.  Both drinks were very chalky, way to chalky to be refreshing like other establishments I have tasted.\n\nMy overall opinion, airport food isn't cheap by any means, therefore the eateries should be working harder to make each order wonderful.  As a side note, by the time my plane got to it's destination both my girlfriend and I had real bad stomach aches...
Always fantastic, dinning in or taking out, doesn't matter, it's always delicious, and consistently served or packaged with the highest standards. A+
First time visit about 2 weeks ago with the boyfriend. Got the beef shawarma and gyro platter. BOY, WAS IT ALOT OF FOOD (for $10 even!). I particularly liked the beef shawarma as it was nice and moist and just enough spice. I also ordered a side of dolma and we got a greek salad with the platter. The dolma leaves were kinda spiny, but the spice in the rice was great. I am hoping to make this my \"Mediterranean place\". :D
Was getting my muffler fixed at the shop accross the street and needing a couple hours to kill; I decided to grab some lunch. \n\nLucky for me I noticed the vibrant colored van outside and while admiring the vehicle i caught myself tapping along to the music. How couldn't I give this place a shot? Walked in and greeted by a friendly staff who were helpful in explaining their menu. I think they offer awesome choices and i settled on the white widow sandwich (chicken, bacon ranch sub), chips and a drink. Took my seat and admired the beverage selection while i waited for my order to be ready. I sat down and paged through the local events paper and enjoyed the atmosphere. What else could you ask for? Oh yeah, the subs are delicious! Overall will return and recommend. Check it out!
Walk in and you'll be hear the usual loud yells of the izakaya staff. Still, this place wasn't that full on a Friday night, so it's not too loud all the time like busier izakaya-style restaurants. The service was friendly and very quick. They came back very often and the food came quickly. Now on to the food.\n\nHits:\nTakoyaki - Soft and delicious takoyaki! They do top it off with bonito flakes, but they could put a bit more octopus inside.\n\nChicken Karaage - That is some delicious, tender chicken! I love the way they fry it. My only complaint is that they only give you some salt/pepper to flavour it. \"Spicy dipping sauce\" was an extra $1.50.  I assumed they would give you some sort of regular sauce at least. Nope. It just comes off as a money grab to me... like charging plum sauce for spring rolls or ketchup for fries.\n\nBeef Sukiyaki - This dish is very sweet but I still liked it. They give you a generous amount of beef, veggies and eggs. Udon was an extra $3. and they barely give you any! \n\nMisses:\nTuna tataki - Not the best tataki I've had. The flavour wasn't there, but the fish was pretty fresh.\n\nThis is one of the few places in the area that offers Japanese food that's not typical or sushi. And the food is not too shabby! The only drawbacks are those little charges they tack on for things that should not be an extra charge in the first place.
This Chipotle is in a much needed location, but it needs a visit from Jon Taffer of Bar Rescue to come straighten this crew out. \n\nIts the most unorganized, slow line in history. 1/6, or so is usually courteous, makes my meal taste just a little under par. \n\nStep it up guys!!!
Very friendly and delicious Japanese cousine.  Highly recomended if you want a quick bite or anice dinner. Quality sushi and sashimi along with other food options.
Not the best sushi. \nThis place looked promising with all the good reviews, however I left disappointed. We ordered the salmon lovers combo and the snow valley roll. It started off well, the complimentary soup was a nice change from the standard miso. The Sushi however is subpar. Granted, we got A LOT salmon, but the rice was undercooked and you can tell the salmon was frozen as it was so cold. The snow valley roll was supposed to have unagi (eel) in it but to be honest, if there was any it was only skin. More avocado than anything, and for the price, it's definitely not worth it. Disappointing.
I can only speak to their brunch because honestly their beer (imho) would put them in the one star category-it's all basic, same taste, low abv type ales - so you will see nothing here about the regular menu or their beers. \n\nI will give top shelf credit to their Mimosas with pineapple juice and a shot of Chambord - baller! Like a perfect French Martini.  \n\nI also highly suggest taking advantage of the made to order Rum Chata French Toast or the Eggs Benedict.  The regular buffet shines with glorious parmigiana reggiano hash brown potatoes, the best damn bacon I've ever eaten and croissants that are flaky, cracky (sound wise) and buttery as in France. They seriously are that good.  (And yes I've been to France  the ppl are also not as nice as the folks at GCB.)  \n\nAt 11 they start serving alcohol - so our 10 am reservation mean we were hunkering down for a while (remember the mimosa) and we got to see that at 11 am the carving stations open up - a pasta comes out, soup and mashed potatoes - hello my fellow Irish - carbo loading! \n\nOk so in summary if you can't tell I wish we got here more than we do - we don't.  It's usually once a year for my birthday which this year Easter screwed up lol - so I hope to make it more frequent. \n\nHigh double to our serve Robin who rocked it while running around to a bunch of tables and never stopped smiling - she.was.excellent. \n\nAnyone wants a brunch partner count me in!
I have only been to Granite City for brunch, so I can only review that portion of their menu, but I think the food is easily worth the $18 if you come hungry... They have prime rib, amazing cinnamon buns, bacon, sausage, cheesy shredded potatoes, mashed potatoes, alfredo pasta, soup, waffles and french toast with toppings, biscuits and gravy, an omelet bar, plus salad, pastries, and fruit. And that is only the stuff I can remember off the top of my head, so needless to say, there is a large variety. They do only have the brunch on Sunday mornings, and there are a lot of large groups who go, so you may have to wait in line for a minute or 2 to get food, but it is so delicious it's worth it. \nThey do try to push selling beer at all hours since they are technically a brewery, and to be honest that is the last thing I want on a Sunday morning, but that is my only complaint.

our new favorite place!  The waitress was SO helpful picking out foods we wanted to eat, and my 7-yr old even found something he liked.\n\nI can't remember the names of the foods they got, but we asked her if the lamb was real, or some sort of steak-lamb or spam-lamb. She said it was real, but it seems and tastes more real in 2 particular dishes (one of which my hubby tried). Apparently the shish-kebob lamb is real but may taste pressed or look unreal or something, which must be common in various restaurants, because this is the first place he's found what seemed to be real lamb meat.\n\nThe chicken tikka tandoori was wonderful and a huge portion--all 3 of us ate from my plate. The naan at first tasted different, but when it cooled down, it was really really good (and huge).  \n\nThe samosas were medium-sized; I have not been able to find those very small ones that they sell in other countries; guess I won't find them here in America.\n\nEven the soft drinks tasted well-blended (often a problem in restaurants).\n\nThey took our Entertainment coupon gladly.\n\n I didn't see any baby seats, and so we had to prop the car seat on a chair for our sleeping baby.\n\nFYI we went during the week and saw no dinner buffet (maybe there was one? not sure) but she said it was PACKED on the weekends, so maybe it's only a buffet on the weekends.
Hong Kong Typhoon-shelter CRAB!  Nothing else needs to be said.\n\nIn old days when fishing was still the way of life, there were typhoon-shelters for fishing boats to wait out for safety.  Fishermen from nearby countries, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, came here too and while they waited what better to do than conjuring up yummy dishes with their catch from the sea.  Voil\u00e0, a fusion style of cooking was born.  \"Typhoon-shelter cooking\" is characterized by strong flavours and spiciness, liberal use of garlic and hot pepper that are not common in other Hong Kong dishes.  \n\nBow Kee manages to find very large crabs (def more than 2 lbs) for this dish.  The crab is flash-fried, and then covered by a topping that consists of fried garlic-chili-minced meat pieces and crispy fried anchovy.  The aroma is intoxicating as your waiter carries the dish towards you; all manners out the door and your hands go right in.  \n\nAny leftover toppings?  Pack it in a doggy bag and it's great with congee or noodles the next day.\n\nThis restaurant is known for \"rice dish in clay pot\" (namesake of the Restaurant), but I'd pick crab over that any time.\n\nThis is a late-night spot.  They don't open until 5:00PM, stays open until 3 or 4:00AM the next morning.
Small cozy seating area. Black chalkboard table. Homemade focaccia bread. Overall good coma inducing. Came here for breakfast with a friend and got absolutely food wasted. We were the first people in the joint at 9:30-apparently because people stay in when it rains (totally valid). Started with the special donuts - lemon curd and whip. DELICIOUS! They are a bit denser than your regular donut holes, but they have a bit of a crunch on the outside and a soft cakey center. The lemon curd was on point and melted into the warm donuts! Then I had the patatas bravas. So great - had a generous side salad and delicious spicy aioli sauce. Friend had the French toast and was totally defeated by it - 4 huge slices of the thick and dense homemade focaccia bread doused in apples, mascarpone, and whip cream. Overall great time and great service. E2, we concede delicious defeat!
Amazing!! Seriously though I just ate the most delicious meal. I ordered the fried polenta and peppers without any add ons. I was a little nervous because I usually don't eat vegetarian type meals, however, I am so very happy I picked this dish! The flavors were amazing and I'm a huge fan of the goat cheese. Also, the service was fantastic. My grandmother is allergic to dairy and mentioned that to the server who then helped her out by going through the menu quickly and saying what has dairy and what would still be good without dairy. She was just really helpful about everything just like a server should be. I cannot wait to come back especially for the brunch. I am so lucky I live only  a block away and if I had a higher paying job this place would be my go to for sure. \nFood: Amazing!\nServer: Great!\nAmbience: Perfect!
Lac Vien just kind of popped up suddenly in the middle of no where. \n\nLocated in a plaza where Subway and McDonalds rules (the lunch choices for people working in the area) and Lac Vien is a welcome additional in this neighbourhood.\n\nThe interior is clean, spacious and open. A lot of windows seating that overlooking Markham Road that traffic zooming along way above the speed limit. Music is \"romantic\" and \"loud\" with the dial set at Sirius XM  Love.\n\nPho House Special Large ($7.50) is one of the better ones in Scarborough area as the broth has a nice aroma of herbs and the beef quality was good (the beef brisket was so tender even with its thicker cut!). The soup itself though can be a little hotter maybe I should request that next time?\n\nIced Coffee with Condensed Milk ($3.50) is made not from the traditional metal French drip filter but from a BVB coffee machine. A perfect \"dessert\" drink for me though.\n\nService was fast and polite! \n\nLac Vien definitely a good Vietnamese restaurant if you have some cravings for Vietnamese food. They serves more than Pho! I think I will be back to try their Phnom Penh Noodles next time!
Order for delivery for the first time yesterday. Thought I'd switch up from the usual Papa Johns. I ordered online and was quotes 45 minutes for delivery. I thought it seemed kinda long, but figure whatever. My pizza finally arrive after and hour and 10 minutes. The pizza cold and I had to reheat in the oven before I could eat. The only reason I'm not giving just 1 star is because one the pizza was hot it was fairly decent tasting. However I will never order pizza from here again.
When I came here I immediately felt like I was in France. The people who work here are so hospitable , welcoming n friendly. They even greet you in French at the door . They have an assortment of sweets direct from France. I only had their creme br?l\u00e9e so far. Can't wait to come back to try more stuff. Bonus; washrooms are very clean .
Yummmmm!!!!  I got the steak with lobster mashed potatoes.  The steak was just okay; I've had better, but the mashed potatoes were AMAZING!!  There were actually huge chunks of lobster in it.  I just kept eating everything else off my plate just so that I could save the mashed potatoes for last.  \n\nThe service was really good.  We were taking our time at dinner and just enjoying each others' company.  The server didn't seem to mind when he had to come back several times to see if we were ready to order.  \n\nGood food, good company, good times.  I would do it again in a heartbeat.
This place was alright. We were able to get last minute reservations on a Monday night.\n\nAtmosphere was great. Very Modern.\n\nPasta was pretty good.  All of there pasta is made fresh daily, so I would stick to this when ordering. My boyfriend got the Mushroom Raviloi, and it was pretty good.\n\nChicken Picattta was disappointing. For a $26, I don't think it was worth it. It was basically a breaded and fried chicken breast with very little sauce. Served with fingerling potatoes and spinach. I was so hungry and ate most of it, but the whole time was thinking, we totally make his dish better at home.\n\nService was okay. We felt like our server was being a bit condosending with the answers to our questions. That was a disappointment as well, but that was just one server. The other servers who helped us out were great.\n\nWe probably won't be back since there are so many other places to eat in Vegas, but if you're looking for some good, freshly made pasta at the Venetian, this would be the place to go
By far, the best pizza I have ever had.  We liked it so much that we returned to have a different pizza the next day. \n\nThe pizza was light, the crust amazing, and absolutely no grease on the underside of the dough, even after it sat for a bit....the BEST pizza ever. \n\nService is amazing.  Order coffee, and watch them refill it before you can even try to finish it. \n\nAmazing!
Top notch selection of quality meats and sides.\n\nI've been here several times but stopped by yesterday for a quality birthday steak, a twice baked potato, and bacon.\n\nI love the expertise of the employees here and the overall ambiance. It's second to none. Prices are comparable to the local grocery stores; quality is above and beyond what you can find elsewhere in the area (except maybe the U of I Meat Sciences Lab).
We made reservations for a family get together.  It was everyone's first visit at this location. We picked the CH because we figured that out of all the restaurants in Vegas to choose from, it was a guaranteed safe bet that everyone in our family would be satisfied.  The setup this location is very nice.  It has a beautiful aquarium that can be seen throughout and the tables along the wall were more than accommodating for our large group.  We had two of the best waiters (Paul and Edward) you could ask for.  They were very knowlegeble of the menu and knew the details of how the food choices would be prepared.  Also, can't forget their fun factor.  They joked with us and fit in like they were family all while providing excellent service.  Everyone enjoyed their food and experience at this location.  I definitely recommend and will be returing the next time I'm on this side of Vegas.
We actually dined here two consecutive evenings, with different views of the fish tank and different dishes on each night. We had the same server, who was good, and enjoyed ourselves each time.
We visited the Chart House for my 30th birthday. As Vegas locals we were wary of a restaurant downtown, but once inside we completely forgot we were in a casino. The aquarium was amazing and kept my 9 year old entertained the entire time. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and one staff member even took my daughter to go see the moray eel in the tank. \n\nThe food was very good, not the best I've ever had, but very appropriate for the prices. The calamari and ssanjang shrimp appetizers were delicious, the baked stuffed shrimp was amazing, the prime rib was adequate, the ahi was great, and the fish and chips was perfect. The souffl\u00e9 wasn't my favorite, mainly due to the texture, but the chocolate lava cake with the house special peanut butter swirl ice cream was to die for. \n\nThe staff really made this place amazing and made our experience one of a kind. Our server was so friendly and attentive. They also gave us specially printed menus wishing me a happy birthday along with a card signed with all of the staff who helped us. The atmosphere is pretty loud but that was perfect for our boisterous party of 8. \n\nIn all, I would definitely recommend this place, especially for a celebration or for a romantic date out. Just be sure to make a reservation and request a seat next to the tank.
The stafs have no respects for the customers. They were talking loudly to each other about eating all kinds of meat. Do they now that it's a vegetatian restaurant? They all gave me a very bad sense when I looked at them.\n\nThe food was tasteless and there were only a tiny bit of ingredients in a plate of fried rice. Will never ever go back. No wonder they were so empty.
Charged $3 for veggie burger substitute for its various signature burgers when a stand alone veggie burger is cheaper than the other meat burgers. Very shady business practice!
One of the few bright spots in the culinary wasteland known as the North Hills.  Buffets gross me out, but their lunch buffet is the exception.  For dinner, go with a group and order family style...you're bound to get 1-2 killer dishes.
This is one of my favorite Indian restaurants. They have a variety of vegetarian and vegan choices, as well as many meat dishes. \n\nYou can easily drive past this place unless you know where it is (Right beyond Mad Mex and a Mattress store as you drive south on McKnight Road--before Ross Park Mall). They have a parking lot that fills up on weekend evenings, but you can park nearby without a problem. \n\nI love the owners of this restaurant. They are charming and very pleasant. They visit the tables and make sure guests are happy. The waiters/waitresses are mostly attentive and friendly. We've had a few problems with not getting food we ordered or getting the wrong food. I chalk this up to the fact that the place is usually busy and little mistakes happen. They are quick and willing to correct mistakes. \n\nThere is a buffet that most people seem to opt for. I see people making multiple trips with plates piled with their fragrant, steaming choices. The aroma makes my mouth water! Smells so delicious! We typically order from the menu because I'm a big fan of leftovers, which (like all places) you can't take if you visit the buffet.\n\nDuring our last visit, the three of us--without discussion with each other--all ordered the chicken tikka masala. Something must have inspired us (the aroma of someone else's food?) and it turned out to be a great choice. The sauce was creamy with the perfect amount of spices. Not too overwhelming, not at all bland. Our friend who accompanied us is 2nd generation Indian and she gives it her hearty approval. She has dinner here with her parents fairly often. The nan was warm and tender--great for scooping up those last bits of sauce. \n\nRather than eating at the many chain restaurants nearby, this is great choice for authentic Indian food. The service is prompt and the food is delicious. We always leave happy.
I have no problem being a player hater but I can't do it with Lola, this restaurant always lives up to its reputation as the best in Cleveland and it did so again last Saturday when we were there.\nI also have no problem writing long reviews but really there's not much more to be said that every Yelper doesn't already know. \nAtmosphere and wait staff -- Oozing with more class than we deserve\nDrinks -- An encompassing wine list and creative cocktails done by bartenders who take pride in their work.\nFood -- Every entree is a medley of harmonized flavors and textures perfectly prepared but yet they will still pale in comparison to the beef cheek pierogi appetizer ($12).\n'Nuff said.
If you speak to anybody that lives in Cleveland and you ask them for a restaurant recommendation, one of the first places to come out of their mouths will probably be Lola.  How can I turn that down?\n\nI perused the menu online before I went just to make sure it wasn't all steak.  I was pleasantly surprised that there was spicy yellowtail sashimi on the appetizer menu.  Unfortunately, when I went to order it, it wasn't on the menu that evening.  But they did have a variation, so I ordered it and gobbled it up.  It was a bit more Hawaiian than I'd like, but nevertheless it agreed with my tummy.\n\nFor my main course I had the pasta:  fettuccine, winter greens, butternut squash and sweet potato.  I was stuffed half way through and if my body would've let me, I would have kept on eating until I exploded.  I'm not even a pasta fan but it wasn't traditional and my my was it delicious.\n\nMy only recommendation would be to go on a night that isn't that busy and definitely steer clear when there's a Cavs game--you'll never get out of the parking lot.
Had dinner two nights ago and it was amazing!  The service was exceptional and the care they took because I have food allergies was above and beyond my expectations.  Everything I ate was cooked exceptionally from the roasted cauliflower appetizer to the hanger steak that was cooked perfectly.  The best part was the fries!  I highly recommend it.
Cocktails, service, dinner, atmosphere...all fantastic! Couldn't have asked for a better evening.
This is as local-business as it gets - this deli has been around for decades. For Phoenix, that's like a millenium. I've been to Cheese and Stuff for lunch about 8 times in the past year, and I've always had a delicious sandwich. They have a huge menu and I'm sure if you want something that's not listed, they'll make it for you. I can't remember the owners' names, but they are always friendly and happy to see you. The dining room does leave a bit to be desired so plan to take your sandwich to go - the only suggestion I'd make for cheese and stuff is perhaps tout yourself as to-go only, lose the tables altogether and make a little more room for unique German gifts and such. Perhaps add a delivery service instead? Okay, now I'm dreaming.\n\nPS in the summer time you can get a fresh squeezed 32 ounce lemonade for a dollar. It is FANTASTIC.  And the iced tea is delicious and always fresh.
I have been going here for about twenty years and have tried almost everything. Not disappointed with anything. Favorites are the Tyler and the doughboy. Or my favorite, I tell them to.surprise me.
I just started working in the central phoenix area, and have to say that Cheese n stuff quickly became my favorite lunch stop around.   They use boar's head meats/cheese on their sandwiches and other quality ingredients in their sides.  The shop is small and quirky, and it's probably best as a carry-out location (they do have some tables inside, and although I've never seen all seats filled, I suppose that's a possibility). \n \nIts reasonably priced, with a gigantic menu and selection.  Their breakfast sandwich is delicious, as is everything I've had for lunch.  In fact, on more than one occasion where I have gone for breakfast and lunch in the same day.\n\nIf you like sandwiches, and miss east coast deli's, this place is for you.
Cute little family owned sandwich shop in uptown. \nGreat meats and (duh) cheeses. \nGood selection of specialty sandwiches, with printed descriptions randomly taped all over the walls. \nTypical of this kind of place, it's a little slow and prices are higher. \nGreat location, I'm putting it on my regular rotation.
I just re-visited Cheese 'N Stuff this weekend after a while.  I guess just eat during their limited hours very often.  They close very early (4pm).\n\nI love their liverwurst sandwiches and the Bismark but this time I decided to try the Doughboy people speak of minus mayo as I do not enjoy warm sandwich lubrication.  As ever the place is tiny, homey and spotlessly clean.  I had some of the hot German Potato salad as a side and a ginger ale.   All were yummy, delicious and satisfying! \n\n As I was eating I had a yen for a Celery Soda to go with this classic sandwich but I've only been able to get them at Chompie's in the valley.  There are loads of interesting European cookies to get packages of as dessert so grab a couple of friends when you go but carpool as the lot is smallish.  I guess they stopped giving pickles with sandwiches, bummer.
Damn great place!  I am a fan of Michael Symon from his cooking on TV.  Never ate at one of his restaurants, except at airports around the US which are catered to a different concept.  Lola was very good.  We sat outside on the patio which was great.   They have a good menu.  Not too overwhelming.  Specializing in 10-12 entrees at most.   \n\nDecided to have the Ribeye for two.  It was cooked perfectly as well as all of the sides.  Great offerings for Apps and Sides.  The Drink menu is wonderful as well.  Had a Georgia Mule to start which was fabulous.  \n\nI will definitely go back.  I am in town for business, so I might have to try his BBQ restaurant next door tomorrow.
This is a sleek and stylish restaurant that opens up as a huge dance floor on certain nights, especially Fri & Sat. This is where the good looking people come to party and if you're not there early enough, you may not be allowed inside.  Wood 35 is at the southern entrance of where St. Laurent becomes epic at its intersection with Sherbrooke.  From that point going north until its intersection with Mont-Royal, you will find dozens upon dozens of venues where you can party in one of Canada's most famous streets.  Wood 35 is a fixture on this scene and as it empties out after last call you will see some of the highest concentration of attractive people you have seen anywhere.\n\nThat said, Wood 35 is full of beautiful people but, as you can imagine, it is pretentious. The music is good and the bartenders are hot, but you will pay a lot for drinks and it can get quite crammed inside. It is also very dark so it's hard to get a good view of what someone actually looks like while inside.\n\nI recommend this place for at least a visit if you like high end nightlife and have a good group of friends who appreciate the same. Perhaps come have dinner and then hang around for the party afterwards.
Food is great, but a little pricy given the small portion.  We made reservation for 1:00 pm, but the restaurnat was quite empty at that time. They are serving Uni Don ($28) these days, so don't miss the chance! My friend had Take Kago($17), which is a combination of 5 entr\u00e9e. The eggplant pur\u00e9e and karaage are pretty good.
We are a fan of the other Rivertowne locations, so when we couldn't get into Bettis Grille (for the third time--a 45-minute wait at 11:10 a.m.) we were happy to find that they could take us immediately.  I ordered the Crabby Patty, not expecting much more than a pre-formed crab cake.  Was I surprised!  It was the best crab cake sandwich I ever had, definitely freshly made and all crab.  I also ordered the fruit salad and, again, it was freshly made with ripe fruit, not something out of a can.  Well worth the price paid.  Service isn't always quick, they are always busy on game days, but it is attentive, friendly and accurate.  A plus for the North Side.
Great service, clean restaurant and best of all the food is so, so good! I've had the chicken roti twice, and it's been amazing each time. They have affordable daily specials for just $5.25! I can't describe how much I absolutely love this place! \nIt's a must try!
Amazing management amazing employees everybody is so happy and genuine. Definitely will be returning to this restaurant. Food was great and could tell it was freshly cooked. Everyone should go there.
Just walk in and the smell will instantly make your mouth water. Great deli counter and of course you have to walk past the bakery to get to the checkout. Not a big place but if you are hungry for guilty pleasure food, they will satisfy that hunger.
It's ok...their food comes on a hot plate that seems to be frozen and then microwaved not made in the oven. We had the combo plates and there was no differentiation between the burrito, chalupa and taco because they all had the same sodium-full red sauce. \nNothing authentic about this place, will definitely not be going back!
I love this place! Fun, casual atmosphere, sports bar-ish, but there is seating to eat separated from the bar. Fried pickles, blackened fish sandwich, burgers, everything I've had here has been delicious!
Wait time for order was 15 mins but that was AFTER I spoke up and told the scared young man at the counter that my order number had been skipped. Chaos between female hispanic manager and irate drive up customer who had come in to get his order corrected, stopped ALL orders from being served. Customer service on manager's part was HORRIBLE!! While all customers waited near counter for their orders, she engaged in foul language and shouting with angry customer. A young, black female with freckles on her face saw nothing was being done and jumped in and started asking each waiting customer what their order was and SHE got the orders together and people served. This young lady deserves a reward for being in control when the manager WAS NOT!!! Every time I come to this location, the wait time is longer than other McDonalds and the older women who work the counter are REALLY slow and seem to have problems with english. I am done with giving this McDs anymore chances for my business. They just cannot seem to get it together.
Food was excellent, service was great. Love the patio overlooking the lake. Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in the area.
This review is strictly for the pepperoni pizza. It may seem a bit pricey on the menu for such a plain dish, but I assure you it is well worth it. The cheese just melts in your mouth as the whole thing just dissolves on your taste buds. The service is a bit slow to start out with, but as soon as that pizza comes out. All the waiting feels like nothing.
I was very disappointed in this restaurant. I'm not one to give low stars but this place just did not cut it for me. The food was bland and overpriced. The service was generally okay, so I won't harp on that. But let's talk food quality. We ordered the gnocchi and chicken Cesar salad. Let's talk about the salad, it was pretty gross. The lettuce wasn't good, and the chicken was dry. I could hardly eat it. It tasted like it was sitting in a fridge for a few days. Then the gnocchi, that was better but not by much. They were cold when served and deep fried. Now granted I'll take that the frying of them could just be their style but cold and fried. Yuck. Last thing I'll comment on is the dipping sauce for the gnocchi. It tasted like they opened a jar of Prego and put it in a container. \nI was really disappointed by my experience. I hope you guys won't take this as me wanting to bash you. You have a lovely spot and potential to be really good. Please, work on it.
Good food, view & service.  Lake Las Vegas is a well kept secret.  We shared wine, pizza, pasta in a bit of peace & quiet.
Talk about getting your monies worth! Anyone who has dined at the Old Town Coffee House will never walk away hungry. A great bargain for the money, the OTCH has many delicious breakfast options, including an amazing Veggie Benedict and delicious coffee, and a friendly staff that have won the hearts (and stomaches) of my friends and family.
Whenever I'm in town for work, I make a point to eat here. The coffee is always hot and fresh, the meats and cheese they use for their salads and sandwiches is so delicious and the bakery items are no joke! I haven't had their breakfast yet, but I hope to someday! The wifi is good, so you can get work done over your meal if you need to. It can get pretty busy during lunch, so be courteous and don't take a large table I you're a party of one! And get a cinnamon roll. They are divine and as big as my hand!
Their sushi is always so good! Except tonight, we ordered delivery tonight everything was fine until I ate the masago nigiri. The minute I put the nigiri in my mouth I was over come with the strongest chemical taste in my mouth. I spit the food out ran straight for the bathroom and proceeded to vomit for 5 minutes. I cannot explain what it was my boy friend ate the other piece of nigiri sushi and it was totally fine. 15 minutes later the same bitter tasting burn is in the back of my throat. I have tried everything at this point to get it out of my mouth and nothing has worked.
This is one of my fave restaurants in the city.  The service is usually amazing.  The food is really really really good.  On our last visit the crab cakes were amazing!  Juicy and filled with really large chunks of crab.  The portion size was perfect for an appetizer.  I had the seafood risotto.  What a treat!  It's was delicious and filled with large pieces of lobster!\nDessert was maple creme Brule.  Heavenly!
To be quite honest, my husband and I ended up at Annona for afternoon tea by process of elimination, but I'm happy we did. \n\nA word about afternoon tea, first - we go about once a year, and it's always a relaxing, indulgent luxury.  We want good tea and as much attention to presentation and ambiance as to the food.  It's gotta feel elegant and pretty, or it's just thirty or forty bucks for a pot of tea and some nibbles.\n\nAfter a few weeks of desperate, shoulder-tightening sleep-denying stress, we decided to treat ourselves to a massage-and-tea day.  However, this was easier said than done: the Library Bar doesn't serve on weekdays anymore (bah) and the Windsor Arms tearoom was booked up three days past our date.  The King Eddie doesn't even serve on weekdays anymore.  We decided to give Annona a whirl.  What the heck?\n\nI was pleasantly surprised.  Though it's served in a dining room and not a tearoom, it was still a lovely place for tea - rich blue walls and blue velvet seating, lots of natural light from big windows overlooking the lobby entrance and Avenue Rd., and attractive wood trim.  It was miles better than the time the King Eddie stuck us in a sterile modern-white dining room.  There were a few other occupied tables, but it was midweek-quiet.\n\nThe service was pleasant and formal, though not cringing like that one guy at Windsor Arms (pace W.A., your scones are unchallenged).  The music - an etherial pop singer or something -  was fine, though I'd prefer some jazz and classical piano.  We had plenty of elbow room, which I like.\n\nThe tea menu was solid, with the English standards, a couple of herbals, a green, and a jasmine white tea.  I always like to see a floral black tea (with rose or lavender) but that's a personal preference and may be weird of me.  A non-floral white tea might also be a good addition.\n\nMy prosecco arrived with a martini glass of cut sweet-tart strawberries - a lovely touch, though the luscious, ripe ones currently at farmer's markets would have pushed it over into amazing.  Then the tea, proper heavy silver strainers (I adore those, and it doesn't feel like afternoon tea without them), and the milk.  The sugar was already on the table: brown and white cubes and packets of free-running sugar and substitutes.  A sugar bowl would have been more traditional, though I'm sure some people appreciate the selection.  The tea service was a satisfyingly silly pink thing decorated with birds and flowers and whatnot, and it brightened up the table perfectly.  The set's modern lines offset the pink and meshed with the rest of the room's decor.  The cutlery was heavy silver.\n\nThe sandwiches were elegant and a bit weird, as tea sandwiches tend to be. I adored the richness of the boursin-cranberry-walnut cone, though my husband was put off by it.  The cheddar-and-cress pinwheel started off nice, but a flavour I couldn't identify became too dominant.  I liked the inevitable salmon sandwich much more than usual, though it was a vasty substantial thing with a half-caper the size of an olive on top and a too-gooey rippling layer of cream cheese on top.  The mouthfeel was a bit odd, but I can't deny it was delicious.  The carrot-und-hummus was elegant and practically unnoticeable. I can't speak to the chicken, as I kindly traded it to my smoked-salmon-hating husband.\n\nThe desserts arrived in a tiered stand.  There was Greaves jam and a good-sized pot of clotted cream each.  We are clotted cream barbarians, but there was even enough for us.  I was unsure about the miniature scones at first, but it worked out well - the smaller size allowed us to eat almost all our pastries and still heap clotted cream on our tiny scones.   The macaron was super-sweet and one-note, but the nutty white chocolate-mint layer cake was a surprising standout - subtle and sweet and minty.  I never got around to the pistachio-crusted eclair, but my husband like it very much.\n\nThen there was the bill, which was significantly lighter than at the top-drawer places (about $30 as opposed to $40). Annona may not be the best in town, but we had a really nice time, it felt like afternoon tea, and I could happily return here on a weekday.
Henricks is a nice bar with a friendly atmosphere, its certainly not one of my locals but its always a pleasure to pop in for a drink before or after a meal at The Apartment which is next door. Henricks normally has a couple of real ales on available and a seat beside the window with a pint is nice way to spend a hour watching the world go by.
I think I have a problem, I've been here four times in the last two weeks. I won't go anywhere else for pizza now. The atmosphere is \"mom and pop\" with a quieter bar around the other side. The staff is also very nice. \nReasonably priced drinks, $5 pizza on Monday's and $4 pasta on Wednesdays. I wasn't particularly impressed with the chicken parm (hence the 4 stars) but the lasagna is pretty good. Their fish sandwich is hand battered to order and takes a few minutes so heads up. It's also HUGE. Go for the pizza if nothing else, then go back for more pizza. \nDid I mention the pizza is good?
Ordered stuffed peppers and had it for lunch the next day. Didn't realize it until the next day but the meat was raw! Called to complain about being sold raw stuffed peppers and the waitress decided that she was the manager and told me that it's the chef's fault and did not apologize or even tried to accommodate me. Luckily, I was able to reach the owner in regards of the issue and he was willing to be responsible for any issues I may have due to eating the raw sausage and was willing to refund my money back. Sadly, I don't think I will be returning.
What a Joke! We went Friday afternoon about 5, only a few tables of other customers. The server started out great, explaining in detail about how they smoke the pork in the basement, burger is purchased locally and telling my kids how the Mac and Cheese is homemade, not the Kraft stuff out of the box most places serve. Good! That's what we'll order! Waiting the next 1/2 hour for our food was somewhat entertaining. Watching several tables angrily talking with the Mgr wondering where their food was, returning food and drinks back as they were wrong and guests leaving in a huff. Finally, OUR FOOD!  Not good! After 20 minutes we finally saw our waitress again...her reply \"I'm sorry I haven't been over to check on you, but the other waiter just walked out.\" \"Oh my gosh, that's Kraft Mac and Cheese, they changed it!\" \"And your burger, it's raw\"! I'm gonna get the Manager to credit your bill.  After watching the owner walk past our table several times without even acknowlaging us, we paid the uncredited bill and left.  The waitress's response as we left summed it up \"I wouldn't blame you if you never came back\".
I chose this location rather than Westlake, which is closer to where I live. That should show how amazing this location is! We called ahead, so we only had a 20 minute wait. We enjoyed our drinks at the bar while we waited. & the bartender was extremely nice & she made our drinks very well. Our servers name was Shawn. He's extremely funny & checks on you extra, but not too much. He makes sure you're taken care of & more !! I love having a server that loves their job, it really does make that much of a difference. Especially with chain restaurants. The food was phenomenal! I got the aged cheddar burger & my man got steak with Mac & cheese & mashed potatoes. I'm a big fan of garlic & my burger called for it. You could definitely taste it! Same with the Mac & cheese!! Also, you see the manager walking around a lot to make sure the guests are satisfied. I'd recommend this location to anyone!
I really like this place. It is a healthy fast food option and I can easily pick up dinner on my way home. I usually get the dressing on the side because they can be generous with the amount and I only like a little dressing.  I have had both the corn chowder and the chicken and rice soups. Loved both.
This was my first time coming and I was on my lunch break. I got my order fast and correct. The wrap was so delicious especially their Caesar dressing and croutons! It cost me $7 for a wrap with chicken and it was definitely worth the price and super filling. I will be coming back frequently!
Fresh and fast salads.I really enjoy being able to pick up such a healthy meal so easily. They have a great selection and every time I have eaten here the ingredients were fresh and tasty.
Great food generous portions and reasonable prices make this  a excellent choice for lunch and dinner or just a snack .
Got delivery and had to wait 30 minutes above the delivery time even after calling to check on my order. Needless to say fries were soggy, sauce and chicken were cold and soup was room temperature. Had no cutlery or condiments even though is ask for some. Was close to giving only one star but portions were good a size.
I always enjoy Johnny Mango! I've been here a few times with my brother, Cyrus N., his girlfriend, Chrysantha R., my sister, Sara N., my mom, Maureen N., and my hubby Joseph F. \n\nI love the quesadillas (I've tried both the chicken and the veggie) and the pomegranate margaritas are to-die-for! Quite strong, though - the first time I had one, it knocked me out - my friend Mike and I could not stop giggling! I've heard that some dishes aren't so great, and while the outside patio is fun, the inside is incredibly loud. It just loses one star for that reason.
I LOVE Johnny Mango!!  All their food is so fresh and locally grown/produced and everything that goes into their meals is truly wholesome and natural.  What great flavors and portions they have and what an amazing difference there is to eating 'fresh' and 'freshly prepared'!  I've been there many times and have never been disappointed.  It's quaint and quirky environment is also friendly and inviting. What a treasure for the full spectrum of appetites: carnivores, vegans, vegetarians, even food snobs will not be able to resist the charm and quality of this place! Am already looking forward to heading back there.
We had an awesome time at this location. Stopping for drinks only, we found that all drafts were $4 and also select pounders were $4. How do you beat that, honestly? The guy sitting next to us actually said that for happy hour, this price reduces to $2.50! I digress..... We sat at the outside bar, which needed a good wiping down, but it wasn't to the point of disgust. The waitress serving our drinks was plenty friendly and some of the other waitresses came over to chat as well, even though I know they were busy. There was a concert across the street so it was pretty packed up until showtime when everyone left- still, I do not believe this affected quality of service. Compared to all other locations, I prefer this outdoor area most, I only wish it was more spacious (N. Huntingdon location is good too, just a little reserved). Overall, we had a great time. Would love to come back for happy hour.
Excellent.  We had the Brassacre (Which I'm told rhymes with 'massacre' -- I thought it should be Brass Acre because you get an acre of brassica -- but I digress) that was superb, right up there with the best pizzas I have had in town (that would the Pizza Lombardino and the Margherita at Bruta).  The crust isn't great -- I was wondering as we devoured how it would taste cold the next morning, but leftovers didn't happen.  We also had the Pinocchio, with sausage, fennel and chiles, and that was really good too (and also completely eaten)  Quiet enough to eavesdrop on the people surrounding us, which is always interesting when first dates are occurring.  We were there on a Monday night 6ish, not too crowded -- seated right away.\nDidn't have desert.  The Ginger Cake looked interesting, but alas I had a tub of Lemon Curd at home waiting for me, so I skipped it.
Pretty good prices! Burgers are very big and super tasty. Love the presentation of the food and the workers were nice. Super clean too.
Super stingy on the veggies- 4 tomatoes and 4 cucumbers on a foot long VEGGIE sandwich! I asked for extra cheese, and of course I was charged for it! I'm used to paying extra for additional cheese, but with the measly amount of veggies, I was hoping.... Also very pushy with trying to get me to buy add-ons like drink, chips, cookies, soup, etc.  I politely said \"no\" out loud, but was thinking in my head I'd probably need all of those things with the miniscule amount of veggies I received. I'll stick with my regular Subway store on Gilbert and Southern where they are very generous.
I stopped by here this past Friday night for dinner with my wife and another couple.  We had reservations for 7:15 and arrived around that time to be immediately seated.  The inside of Sentis is quite interesting and modern.  They have a nice lounge type area with a bar and then a number of tables behind that.  There is also another room that it looked like they were using for a rehearsal dinner the night that we were there and so we didn't really get to see it.\n\nMy wife and I decided to start off our meal by splitting the fritto misto.  It consisted of fried carrots, zucchini, peppers, calamari and shrimp and was quite good.  The breading on it was rather light yet crispy and everything was seasoned perfectly.  I was especially impressed that the calamari was tender as most places tend to over cook it and make it rubbery.  Then for my dinner entree I went with one of the specials for the evening which was lamb t-bones.  It consisted of 3 lamb medallions over top of some gnocchi, peas and mushrooms and had some dollops of pur\u00e9ed carrots and a smearing of black garlic on the plate.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and tasted pretty good.  Senti let the flavor of the lamb come through and didn't try to hide it.  The gnocchi was also decent although I think that they were a little denser than i would have liked.  I did enjoy the flavor produced by dragging them through the black garlic though.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Everything that we had was pretty tasty and I enjoyed the atmosphere.
Came here because there are precious few places outside the Strip and fast food eats where you can get a meal past 10 pm. First, only given breakfast menu, I had to ask for regular menu. Then, only one soup, out of the others.\n\nService was extremely sloppy, making me feel like I was an inconvenience. Then the \"Bennie\" was not all that good. Stopped eating the turkey and am hoping it doesn't make me sick. Avocado was tasteless, and I love avocados, so that was a disappointment.\n\nIcing on the cake was when they seated a family with two screaming children at the table next to me. Restaurant nearly empty, and they had to put already screaming children in my ear.\n\nDidn't even finish my meal, but searched for my waiter (talking to another waiter) to get my check do I could leave.\n\nDoubt I will return.
I've been wanting to check this place out for the longest and omg it was amazing. I love Korean food and bibimbap but this place made it exactly how I remember it and was delicious. The service was good and they were really fast with getting the food out. Definitely bringing my friends in with me next time!!
Terrible, terrible place.  Not good food, rude bartender.   The sandwich I ate literally made me sick.  Rude staff and disgusting food is not a good combination.  Nice room, though.  I liked the atmosphere, but too many low life power drinkers go there.  Not a middle class joint.  This place is not getting off to a good start.  Avoid the 5 spot at all costs...
What a fantastic, refreshing alternative to burgers or pizza!!!  This food is excellent - super fresh and tasty.  My family tried the BBQ Ranch salad and the Roasted Sweet Potato with Strawberry salad - both really delicious.  Very large portions!  We also got items from the specials menu: the veg chili is outstanding, filling, and spicy in just the right way, and the chicken and wild rice soup really tasty - no watery broth here!  I tried the cucumber mint lemonade - not my favorite.  Also tried the chia seed parfait as a shared \"dessert\"...  YUM.  They do desperately need some kind of awning or other sunblock for the walk up window and outdoor seating area for the dinner hour.  But... it's super good food less than 5 miles from home, and reasonably priced, so we will be back.
Honestly this place is amazing! They had wonderful service with amazing food. The Popovers were amazing with sea salt. From the second I arrived I was greeted with smiles and delicious scents!!! If I could this restaurant would have over 5 stars. The food was well cooked and perfect! Love love love!!
I have been in here twice.. the first time was last year shortly after they opened.. I tried both the pork and chicken banh-mi-style sandwiches. I was looking forward to it since I love banh-mi and I like supporting small businesses in my neighbourhood. Unfortunately, the meat in both sandwiches tasted like either it had been sitting out too long or the oil used to cook it was old.. something about the meat just tasted off. Anyway it was disappointing and I didn't go back.\n\nThe second time was this morning. I was surfing Yelp and I came across this restaurant again.. all of the reviews are so positive and the photos looked good. I thought maybe they had improved since being open for a while. So I went in for lunch, and unfortunately this time the woman behind the counter was really rude! I'm not sure if she was the owner or just an employee. Anyway she scowled at me when I walked in. I was looking at their menu for about 5 seconds when she snapped at me if I'm going to order or not. There was literally no one else in the restaurant so I don't know why she was acting like that, maybe she was having a bad day? Anyway I said that I was having trouble reading the sign (it is written in very tiny writing on a chalkboard at the back). Instead of taking the opportunity to tell me about their menu or to make a suggestion about what to order, she told me that \"the majority of people don't have any trouble reading the sign\" in a rude tone of voice. After a moment's awkward silence I just ended up walking out. \n\nNot a good experience. Too bad!
This is my go to place for take-out when i don't feel like cooking. The portions are huge!!! I always have leftovers. I usually get the butter chicker with nan bread. I think just the nan bread is already worth the trip. The sauce for the butter chicken is not very thick, which goes great on rice too.
We visited at 9pm on a Friday. It was very crowded, so we weren't expecting stellar service, but it took about 20 minutes to get our coffee, and the waiter entirely forgot to put our order in the system, so we were not served until well after several larger parties that were seated well after us. It took another 10 minutes to get a refill on the coffee, and I had to ask for water twice before finally receiving two filthy glasses of water. One glass had water stains that looked like it had been sitting on its side in stagnant, dirty dish water for quite some time. Overall, it took over an hour to get a sundae, a waffle, and two coffees, and finally the bill. The vanilla ice cream was freezer burned, but otherwise the food was fine. Just not worth the $30.
The ice cream is to die for...but very, very sweet.  Well, the white chocolate was!  My niece had the waffle with ice cream and apples.  She loved it.  My daughter had the Oreo ice cream and also love it.  Very expensive and can get very crowded.
The atmosphere feels like I'm in Taiwan. I LOVE HOW IT IS SPACIOUS. Lots of room, decorations. Hot pot has a variety of options but it is pretty pricey. 35.99/ person for weekdays and 38.99/person  for weekends. It doesn't include the soup base which will have an additional costs to it. The selection of food and sauces are amazing. Leo has assisted us with our soup bases. Spicy soup base is \"really hot\"  so we were able to water down the soup.  I would recommend starting with the beef and mushroom broth. The service is awesomely fast! It's a great place to come every once in a while.
This place on a scale of 1-10 is a 20!!! Great drinks, awesome food, and you have to try the pineapple knockout martini! The bartender Red is impeccable!  Management is very friendly and courteous. Chris made me feel like I was at home and a long time patron on my first visit. If you come to Belmont and don't visit this place you mossing b out on a good thing!
Wir haben uns mit freunden hier zum abendessen getroffen. Das Restaurant ist eine Bruchbude. Ein grosses Loch in der Decke wo Kabel rausschauen. Dreckiger Boden undichte Fenster einfach nur ungem\u00fcdlich. Das Personal sowas von unfreundlich und \u00fcberfordert (im Restaurant waren au?er uns noch ein Paarchen also in summe 6 Personen) Das Essen war kalt wo es an den Tisch gekommen ist. Geschmacklich nicht gew\u00fcrzt ohne Geschmack einfach nur schlecht. Wir werden in zukunft nicht mehr herkommen.
Ordered a salad , asked for a fork to eat with.  Was told \"We don't have forks but you can go down a few stores to the Mexican place and they will give you one.\"  Had to re check my brain on that statement.  Told them if I wanted Mexican for lunch with a fork I would have gone there.  They got manager on phone and was told to go to Harris Teeter to get fork.  Now I am looking for cameras cause I know I am on Candiid Camera or some other type of reality show trying to see if people will revert back to caveman days and eat a salad with their fingers.  Nope... no camera!  Ask for my money back from the manager over the phone did not want to do that either  but finally did.  True story folks!  Don't believe me??  Stop by and ask for a fork!
I love how many fine-dining restaurants are including vegan options in Toronto these days. I have tried the vegan burger a few times; it's delicious and unique. It's not your typical \"veggie burger\". It's actually a mix of mashed veggies wrapped in a grilled tortilla. The 'mashed' inside is pinkish from the beets. It sounds weird but it's soooo good! I should warn you that they change their menu often to try and make the menu 100% local food (which i admire). The vegan burger seems to stay on the menu though. They also have sweet potato fries and salad to go with the burger. \n\nI have to admit I've never actually dined in the restaurant (there is a recording studio above so i've had their food up there). I also can't comment on price because i've never had to pay for my meal. It is fine-dining so expect slightly higher price range.
best taco shop around :) went in last night for the 1st time. Service was awesome & the quality was great. They have roasted green chiles that are chopped & placed in the salsa bar that tastes just like what my dad makes at home. Will definitely be coming back for more :) authentic tastes
Everything was great!  Best I've had in the area!  Seriously!
It's a restaurant that becomes a nightclub at night. That generally tells you all you need to know about it. Still, the food was better than expected for that time of place. We had some great food there one night. \n\nDefinitely a place to see and be seen.
On the way home from an evening band rehearsal, my beautiful girlfriend convinced me (disclaimer: it takes next to nothing to convince me to try new food, but still...it was late-ish and I was sleepy) to stop in here to try my first walnut ball.\n\nWe ordered 30 balls (we got 31! and the ball-cook at the counter was more than happy to explain the intricacies of the walnut balls to my GF while we waited) of the mixed variety (red bean, walnut, potato) and I was not disappointed. \n\nDelicious cold on the walk home, warmed in the microwave, and again the next day in the toaster oven for lunch, these Hodo Kwaja are an absolute delight, and I'm having a hard time sitting here knowing that there's 5 more sitting in the fridge, waiting to be devoured. I'm imagining them in there yelling \"eat me!\" inside the tupperware, and then after a few minutes of not being eaten, they then start plotting ways to escape the tupperware, bounce off the floor, and roll their way over to my cubicle; Jumping up and down on their arrival, singing \"Don't You Forget About Us\" to the tune of the similarly titled Simple Minds song in high pitched voices that you would imagine tiny walnut cakes would have. \"Hey cakes!\" I'd say \"Be patient! I won't forget to eat you!\" but they won't leave me alone, so you know what...I'm just going to go to the fridge right now and eat the rest.
One of the most delightful things about living near this strip of Bloor is this little gem right here. I'd never heard of nor tasted walnut cakes before! The staff were so amused by my amusement that they gave me samples to try and watched as my chew turned into a grin and I ordered a mix of six with my mouth full. This place is simply charming.
Lol this place really sucks.... I cant even write a serious review.  Bartender was fun but this places needs to be in a bar rescue episode stat. Its in a prime location and has a great patio, what a shame.\n\nI drank a sip of my warm blue moon only to dry heave as it tasted spoiled, never thought i would say that......... Then i ordered a rum and coke, watered down of course. OH! and the bar food.... Is a joke, im not even mad! There were more waiters than customers and the dude who brought my food felt the need to rearrange the fries with his bare hands in front of me.... I guess to make it look nice. \n\nAnyways, unless you are going to drink cheap beer and get plastered, do yourself a favor and head over to one of the many other options along detroit. Also this is probably the only bar that still uses a reciever and cd/cassette combo.
Was good and cheap but raised prices with only noticeable difference being fancy new menus and outrageous prices. Service is slow and forgetful. Food was good before price increase but now not worth it, I'm not even full from the Pho there anymore. They think just because they are in Liberty Village they can hike the prices without doing anything but they are losing customers and respect.
Food was authentic as well as the atmosphere. intense flavors and the Margarita was one of the best ive had. it was clean and the server only spoke spanish which was cool.
I have no clue how this place got a 4-star as the waitress was not friendly and kind of clueless.  We had 8 people and she asked us how many menus we need.  We asked for drinks and the entire page of great Hong Kong style drinks were not available.  Only soft drink is available.  I hope the food was good but the atmosphere was not welcoming for us to try, so we left...
Bis wir auf uns aufmerksam gemacht haben, wurden wir einfach ignoriert.Als Pizzafan wurde ich sehr ent?uscht. Sowohl der Teig als auch der Belag waren einer Pizzeria nicht w\u00fcrdig. Meine Frau (Italienerin) war mit der Lasagne auch nicht zufrieden. Labrig und fad.
A Highland Park satellite of the fabulous Enrico's Biscotti mothership in the Strip District.  I had the impression they were open only for weekend brunch, hopefully that will change as the operation picks up steam.  They have a lovely dining room that opens to a big outdoor terrace, comfortable blackboard-painted tables, fresh flowers, white walls, wooden floors, menu written on a big chalkboard up front.  The food is fresh, seasonal, local, with a focus on Mediterranean cuisine, beautifully presented.  I had an asparagus and goat-cheese omelette with carmelized onions, roasted red potatoes and a frise salad with walnuts, goat cheese, cranberries and balsamic viniagrette -- basic and yummy.  My friend had baked polenta swimming in fresh bright marinara.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table -- we hung out in a downstairs bar area where you can nosh on coffee, tea and biscotti while you wait.   E2 is a great, very welcoming new option for brunch in the burgh -- go and enjoy!
We showed up at 1 (1 hour before they close) for the Sunday brunch and they would not seat us. They said there was already multiple people in front of us, yet every name on the list was crossed off. Very disappointed in their customer service. They were simply being lazy and that is not how a top restaurant should behave.
Great place for sweets, breakfast, and lunch. I love the poblano and roasted corn breakfast Brito. Croissants are tremendously awesome as well. We will be getting our Thanksgiving pies here this year. They are open during the week and on Saturday from I think 8 to 2 or so.
I'm well familiar with their sister restaurant, Crudo, but I stopped here after work today to see it for myself. I just came in to enjoy a cocktail... And was surprised by the BEST Old Fashioned I have EVER had!!! Smooth as silk, and not sticky-sweet.  I'll be back, Mo :-)
If you care about quality food, unique flavor pairings, sharing a bite or two between your fellow diners then Okra is for you! If you're looking for a plate full of slopped pulled pork or some brisket hidden under a sauce and sides to feed an army you may want to pass on the artistry being created by Chef Cullen. Our server Michelle was amazing! Not only did she know the menu in and out but she really had a passion for what was on there! It's always refreshing to see a servers eyes light up when describing a dish, and actually be invested in what she was talking about! I highly recommend asking for Michelle, you will not be disappointed!\n\nNow to the food! These will not be big giant feed your face plates, you are going to get a serving of some real passion and love of flavors, a southern background mixed with some Italian flair. It may sound daunting but please please try it and see for yourself how great a combination these two can be! \n\nStacked salad to start, of course not a tradition Caesar but the flavors are robust and delicious and the corn bread croutons will make you never look at a normal crouton the same!  \n\nVerde focaccia to share, excellent use of goat cheese, you get a good flavor but not over powering mixed with the pesto was on point! Crust was cooked perfectly nice and crispy but wasn't over done. \n\nPimento burger to my self! I have to say I've had this burger numerous times I can't seem to get enough of this. Excellent flavors; the homeboys comeback sauce, the pickles, pimento cheese all mixed in to each delicious bite after bite. I would definitely recommend this to be one of the best burgers in the valley and would put it up against any others you might hold near and dear to your heart.  \n\nOverall you can tell the creators have a pure joy of food making this a very special spot in Phoenix, please go and try it! Be open minded don't get stuck thinking you can only have one plate a certain way liven up your tastebuds!
My husband and I tried Okra for Happy Hour and we loved it! They had a great selection of appetizers. I was pleasantly surprised to find several vegetarian options on their menu, since southern food is usually not vegetarian friendly. We shared the mac n cheese balls, hush puppies, and fried dilly beans. All very delicious. My husband also had the chicken skins. He was in heaven. The cocktails were great. Very potent. Service was great. Warm, hospitable, and helpful with the menu. Try their hot sauce! You won't regret it.
This is my 2nd time dining in here.  The 1st time with my 2 younger daughters: we had Jerk chicken which comes with rice/beans, plantains, and veggie.  This time I had curried chicken with same sides and the veggies was this BOMB braised cabbage/carrot sweet mixture with a hint of cinnamon or something.  The portion is phenomenal!  Oh did I mention that i am pregnant so I am NEVER willing to sacrifice taste or flavor lol.  I only had to wait about 5-10min for my hot yummy plate.  I sat watching CNN, chatting with the daughter about the news and how great the food was. Very cozy atmosphere!  I am from the Bay so I can tell you just how hard it is to find authentic mom & pop restaurants like this who simply cook it up.  This is a hard working family who is just trying to keep their business and dream alive in a horrible economy.\n\nOH did I mention I had THE BEST homemade sorrel too!! damn my mouth is watering just writing about this all over again.  go with a hungry belly, patience, and a kind heart ;)
I met up with some friends here at Toddy Shop. It's located inside Inn Zone, but is moving to a new location very soon. Those who are from Vegas or have lived here long enough remember the days of Inn Zone (multiple locations then with family run business inside) having some of the best food in town, one in particular would regularly have a line out the door just for a bucket of their delicious chicken fingers. With that said, I'd never find it shocking or be surprised to still be able to get a really tasty meal at this now dive bar that could use a makeover. The dining area was clean and I personally wasn't bothered nor smelled any cigarette smoke, but I'm in a fucking bar in Vegas, so it wouldn't have bothered me anyway. Alcohol, food and cigarettes will happen in a bar... get over it. \n\nChef Hemant is the mastermind behind the menu at Toddy Shop. It's clear how genuinely passionate he is about the food being served and service to customers. Chef came out during our meal to make sure we liked it and answered and questions about some of the dishes on the menu. \n\nOur table shared many dishes family style and several things stood out for me. Certain things I was also eating for the first time and it was nice to venture out of my comfort zone to try something different. One thing hubby and I both thought had great flavor was the Rasta Wings that came with some delicious fried plantain on the side. Another dish that stood out was the Pot of Biriyani that had basmati rice, chicken masala, ghee, cashews, raisins and crispy onions which has excellent flavor. Everything we tried right down to the double-cut fried potatoes (ask for Indian ketchup to dip your fries in and thank me later) tasted really good and all of us agreed we'd come back. Wherever Chef Hamant relocates to... his customers are sure to follow.
I've been to mikes place just under 10 times and I've never been disappointed. Yes, it is busy a lot of the time, but it's worth the wait!! Everything I've tried on the menu is delicious. The restaurant itself is just a cool place to visit. I highly recommend Mike's Place. It's one of my favorites!
I *cannot* believe that someone reviewed this before me.\n...\n...\n...\n\nWell, actually YES I can - because it is so awesome.\n\nWhere do I begin about Mike's Place?\n\nLocated in my hometown (read the sidebar, beeotches) this is the place in high school that my pals and I would ditch school to go hang out at...  (Golly, I hope my Mommaship doesn't read Yelp reviews.)\n\nIn college (went to KENT STATE baybee) it was the best place to go after a heavy night of drinking... their belly buster breakfast could cure any hangover...\n\nSince?  Whenever I am home I try to go to Mike's at least once... usually on Christmas Eve morning - with my whole crayzee family - for a great-big-stinking-Midwestern-cheese-sausage-bacon-fried breakfast...\n\nThe food?\nExactly what you'd expect if you saw the outside of this place.\n\nAs the mysterious ? mark Terry M. points out - Mike's Place is chock full of memorabilia...  it is truly a unique place - the bus shell with seating is cool... but, not as cool as:\n\nTHE X-WING FIGHTER IN THE PARKING LOT.\n\nFull scale.\nWho gives a shit on how good the food is?\nX-Wing Mo' Fo' FIGHTER...\nUse the force, Luke...
Crab and crayfish starter - yum.\nSurf and turf main - yum yum.\nBanana and salted caramel cheesecake - yum yum yum.\nService great, ambiance great, wine great... Booking recommended (even though we didn't, we were lucky!)
Wish it was the Taffies that we knew and loved for decades!  It is not.   It is not even a smaller version.  \nNo fresh baked bread with meals.  Used to be what set them apart from the others.\nNo daily specials.  Used to be home-cooked style food that were delicious!\nFrench fries are the mashed potatoes formed into the shape of a french fry, no flavor and not what they used to have!\nGrilled Chicken salad...used to be huge...and had boiled eggs, chicken, tomatoes....  No eggs now!  And small salad.  No cracker bowl, no bread!\nSad!!   Unfortunately the new owners decided to cut corners once they purchased it.  The food quality suffered, maybe that's why they closed down in Champaign?\n\nThe server was kind, no complaints about him.\n\nMight give them one more chance, even though it is a little drive.  Please, Taffies....Come BACK!
I feel if someone is from a specific culture they should know what it means to have good food from that culture. I have have been told by more than one person that \"The Taj Mahal\" is the place to go to get good indian food. \n\nI don't pretend to be an expert but it's a good sign when you see people from that ethnic background eating at the restaurant. It's usually bad sign if you see too many white boys like me lurking around. \n\nI can't remember what I ordered when I went here because the menu tends to confuse and never end. It seems they have listed pretty much every possible combination out on their menu but everything is delicious and authentic. You could pretty much order by closing your eyes and just pointing because everything sounds good and from my experience is good.   \n\nThe place has gotten a few upgrades in recent months making it seem a little less \"hole in the wall\" but the food is the same and worth a trip. They have a buffet that they do at lunch I believe which is different, and something I will have to give a try at some point.
My favourite items are their 1) Chunky Tuna Salad which comes with 3 kinds of fresh tuna diced on top of greens with spicy mayo on top; 2) Snow White Sushi Roll which has seared tai on top of shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber & masago with creamy garlic sauce. \nHouse crunchy noodles are complimentary if you dine at the resto. Food is absolutely delicious!! They recently added an option to substitute rice with quinoa for any sushi rolls - there is a premium ($2-$3) but it's a great option for people who want more proteins instead of carbs in their diet, the 'popping' of quinoa makes the roll much more interesting as well. I would come back again and again!
Very bad service, food over cooked, cold rice, waited over an hour for dinner. Lamb was very tough, couldn't cut it let alone chew it. Vegetable sizzler, veggies were burnt.  Not recommended...3 thumbs down. Not a good value.
I can't believe I haven't reviewed this sooner. It's truly a gem of the north hills. Growing up with a family friend from India I know good Indian food! He has since passed but my love for the food has not. This is the only place I found that even comes close to his cooking. It's flavorful delightful the bread is incredible and you can't go wrong. The buffet is a steal of a price and if you try it you won't be disappointed I can assure you of that! The chicken tikka and the chicken byrani are my favorite chicken dishes. Also if you are looking for veggie try the cashew sauce veggies I can't think of the name but they rock. Not to mention the veggie pakora!! If you are on the fence just go and eat to your hearts desire. Also the gulab little sugar donuts are great too!!
The Taj Mahal is definitely a very good restaurant! I cannot asses neither if it is authentic Indian (even though to me at least seems like authentic) or if it is the best Indian in Pittsburgh (since I have not been to that many other Indian restaurants), but I can asses that it is delicious! Most of the times I have visited I have ordered the chicken tikka masala which is absolutely amazing! I also have a hard time to stop eating the paneer naan because it is so delicious! I still have not tried their buffet and I am looking forward to it because this is a way to try more of their stuff! I will be visiting this place many many times in the years to come for sure!
The day was 5 of May... AKA, Cinco de Mayo! This place looked promising and it definitely did not disappoint! I had the 5 street tacos; two carne and three pollo tacos each in different sauces. The meats were all tender and the sauces were very flavorful, the toppings were like chipotle style where you pick it out but was so much better. My boyfriend had the surf and turf burrito and it was ginormous and delicious. They cooked the shrimp and carne right in front of us and it tasted fresh and the burrito was overall very very good. I'm sure everything on their menu is just as delicious as what we had. This will now be our go to for authentic Mexican food!
I was treated to dinner here a couple days ago while attending a convention in Vegas and this restaurant was a very pleasant suprise. I didn't look at the prices on the menu so keep that in mind. \n\nThe atmosphere was cool and the joint was busy. Our server was outstanding. The calamari with friends was awesome with fried bell peppers and jalapenos mixid up with the perfectly battered squid. The caesar salad was rfg and my rare-medium rare filet was spot on.
I come here about once a month and often try new things on the menu. I'm usually pleased with everything I order and today I feel the same. Cool diner feel with affordable prices!
Absolutely amazing!!!  Our experience was perfect from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out.  The food is top quality, fresh, and delicious.  The tomato bisque was smooth and flavorful.  The steak and salmon melt in your mouth.  The deserts are wonderful but I highly recommend the Tiramisu.  Our server was very professional, attentive, and prompt.  This is a must try if you're in the city but be prepared to pay for this Iron Chef gem.  Cheers!
Hands down for the best Manhattan drink I have ever had. The food was awesome as well, would definitely come back if I visit cleveland.
Great service and fantastic menu all around. What stood out the most for us was the dessert menu....all homemade and very unique.
Breakfast- This is true fast food!!! By the time you drink two sips of your coffee ...BAM....your food is at your table. The meals always taste homecooked and CHEAP!
This is a relatively new joint (about 4wks old).  I went here for drinks and to chill with friends.  It's several stories with a rooftop patio (it is opened yet) and they have ping pong tables set up and something else which I forgot. \n\nOn Sundays per our server they have a DJ playing in the afternoon, so it looks like they are covering all their bases.  I didn't order any food but from where we were sitting it's an open kitchen so you can see the chefs at work.\n\nThe drinks are a reasonable price and they even have a few board games that you can play (I need to work on my Jenga skills!)\n\nDefinitely be back to hang out as it's near my hood :)
We came in with a small group (4) to listen to a friend who was DJing and were enjoying our drinks. A table opened up so we decided to scoop it up while we could. The server was none to pleased that we had sat down before he'd had a chance to clear the table.\n\nSo we were not starting out on the right foot with this guy. After ordering another round of drinks he asked if we wanted any food, and none of us did. His attitude turned from bad to worse in less that 5 seconds. I guess he was looking to score a big tip off us and when he realized he probably wouldn't he couldn't be bothered with us.\n\nNeedless to say, after that we finished our drinks and split as fast as we could. Making our way to another bar, with much better service!
I, apparently, am one of the few people that actually likes My Florist.  I think that all you need to know is that the Jazz pianist kicks ass.  Seriously.  She is fantastic.  Just get a drink, sit at the bar and listen. You don't need a $12 foo foo drink, just get a coke (or a tea, which is chai and yummy).\n\nThe atmosphere is \"wine bar.\"  There are gay men more feminine than me on dates.  There are yuppies. There are snooty old people.  DUH. Come on people!  If you live downtown, you have encountered all of these people in your day, and you came out all right. I am way more hippie than yuppie, and I survived.  (Side note:  Why are there 57 \"wine bars\" in downtown Phx?  Can we get a variety here?)\n\nMF has a decent selection of vegetarian items, and everything that I have tried has been good, but this is not the reason to go to MF.  The pianist is.\n\nSo.  Go here.  Try some good bread (made right next door), and listen to that pianist.  She is awesome.  I want to have her babies.
I remember driving down the alley a while ago and passing a garbage can with a rather sophomoric retort to the restaurant's quickly declining food quality. While callow, I admit to having giggled and nodding. Accurate, in a sense, that the phrase was \"Puke Bread\". Basically, yeah. \n\nI am somewhat biased, as I did work there for a bit, but in this particular scenario, I feel I can identify what other reviewers have noted in regards to the service. \n\nJust so you know, yes, the servers are nonplussed about you being there. No, they don't actually like the food, and chances are, they have a different manager than they had the week before.\n\nSo, why two stars you ask? Have you SEEN the martinis? Whew. Worth my $10.
This place makes me think of the famous line: \"I coulda been a contendah.\" My Florist has so much unfulfilled promise. \n\nYou walk in and the hard wood floors and bright airy space make you think you've walked into a truly urban and unique experience. It's exactly what I might have imagined for a downtown restaurant. \n\nWe started with an appetizer -- the nachos. This is the highlight of my visit. The nachos are served on pieces of toasted baguette with melted cheese. On the side they serve slices of avocado and the salsa is served in a halved avocado shell. It's an interesting presentation and was very tasty. But this is where my pleasure ended. \n\nFor my lunch, I ordered a grilled chicken salad and my friend ordered a Roast Beef sandwich. First, my grilled chicken was not \"grilled\" and it tasted odd. As a matter of fact, I called the waiter over to ask if some mistake had been made. He admitted that the chicken was prepackaged and heated, not \"grilled\" fresh. \n\nMy friend's roast beef sandwich looked like \"old\" processed meat - not like real roast beef. The meat on the sandwich had that shiny metallic look (in my mind I'm cringing as I describe it). \n\nI can't believe that a place that has so much potential and uses fresh baked bread from Willow Bakery could skimp out on the food! \n\nDon't be distracted by the big flashy sign and the reviews in travel magazines and local papers that describe this as a \"unique\" experience. That's ALL this place has going for it ...unique. But if you want good food try someplace else in the neighborhood - like Chevrount's.
Great service, fresh delicious food, ambience is good, portions a little bit small even for \"tapas\", for the price. Paella & Sangria are a must.
This is my absolute favourite pizza place!  The pizza is always tasty.  I love how the flavour of the ingredients mix so well together.  The La Scala and Dominator are my favourites!  I also love that you can ask for their chili oil to add a little more spice and flavour.  Not only are their pizzas good, but so are their desserts!  We always get the Prix Fixe menu and their appetizers are good too.  Too bad they took of the arancini, that was my fave.  Their flourless chocolate cake and tiramisu are yummy!
Terrific from start to finish Lora and Randi treat you as an old friend. Thanks! \n\nFood was exceptional from the OO and parm dip... and on and on.  \n\nKeep up the great work...\nJeff
First time here on sunday....food was fantastic and the service was just as great. The calamari was one of the best I've ever had. Would highly recommend dinner here.
Roots was great! The menu is farm to table and everything was delicious. I have only gone once, but look forward to going back, as I'm sure they are the type of place that will change the menu. They weren't busy and the decor was adorable. They also have free WiFi so if you need to get some emails out while you enjoy a nice lunch, that's definitely a perk. The barista on staff really knows her stuff too, so if you're a coffee snob this is the place for you too. I really enjoyed my experience here, and look forward to returning soon.
Overrated. Our party ordered a variety of dishes and none were spectacular. Food was average. French toast was bad.
I'm pretty pumped that its cooling off outside cause I'll be able to make my way down to Matt's for breakfast on Saturdays again. I tend to stay away during the summer months cause I sweat like a fat kid in a cannibal camp and would rather not wait the hour or so it takes to be seated. \n\nVery few places in town do I feel as \"at home\" as I do at Matt's. The staff is always friendly as are most of the patrons. For such a long wait and for the patrons to be in such good moods they have to be doing something right! The food is fantastic. I love how they find locally grown and raised food and only stock what is in season. The food alone makes Matt's one of my favorite spots for breakfast in town, but its the consistency in the ambiance that makes it my #1 breakfast spot in town.
I went to Matt's the other morning for a solo breakfast before work. I was treating myself because I'd been on a gluten-free diet for over a month and that was the day I was reintroducing wheat after getting some blood drawn, and I'd been literally dreaming about waffles for weeks. \n\nDiet aside, it was such a nice, cheerful way to start my day. I'd been to Matt's before for a Sunday brunch, and we waited forever outside in the heat. This was totally different: I walked in and sat down at the counter, no wait at all, and the waitstaff is very attentive and quick. I found myself smiling out at downtown Phoenix through that big picture window before my beloved waffles had even graced my place setting. \n\nWaffles: solid. Belgian.\nBacon: thick-cut and peppered. I could have eaten 5 more slices.\nHomefries: this is what I remember as being so stand-out from my first visit, and they did not disappoint the second time. Crispy, tasty potato chunks with caramelized onions and sauteed bits of rosemary...oh yum. And they're not even made of wheat.\n\nThanks, Matt, for giving me a lovely mid-week breakfast experience.
Had the steak-bites and iceberg lettuce salad.  Pretty damn good!  Ambiance was trying to be high end.  Very attractive clientele and even more attractive waitstaff.   If cleavage and bodies at least an 8 are your thing, this is the place.  I would go back for the food...change that...I will go back for the food, stay for the people watching.
June 2016\nBeautiful upscale restaurant. Rebecca was a perfect server.\nThe Steak and Crab was excellent. The Steak Oscar was almost excellent.\nA more intimate setting than The Keg. I will try the Prime Rib next time.
Crappy, boring, limpid. \n\nThe pastrami tasted bland, the bread was borderline stale and uninteresting, and the whole sandwich was a little wet and lukewarm. Got a Penn Pilsener from the bar, and it had the unmistakable taste of dirty lines - a little sour tang of lactic bacteria. \n\nHow is this place \"famous\"? Is it really? Can anyone please just brine some brisket and hand-slice it?
I was starving on a Sunday night, and everything else at TI was closed.... so this place was my only option.\n\nThe night before, I had a carrot cake from here. It was alright, but I expected something better for a $7 carrot cake. The desserts at the Aria and Bellagio brunch buffet tasted much better than the carrot cake.\n\nAnyways, I ordered a french onion soup and my boyfriend order a mango smoothie. It took half an hour for the soup to come out, and they still did not bring out the mango smoothie... My boyfriend asked to cancel the smoothie and the waiter said \"it is done, we are looking for a glass for it.\" My boyfriend and I were confused.... is it that hard to get a glass? in a casino? where drinks are served EVERYWHERE?\n\none star for the french onion soup... it was okay, a little bit too salty though.
If you are hung over, tired, and don't have it in you to man the strip, then go here. \n\nThe menu selection is plain and predictable, but I hardly think predictable is what carries over to a good meal. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich was heaven as a welcome meal and a scramble for breakfast the morning after I danced my butt off the night before. Our waiter was funny, and having the traffic he does everyday, refreshingly polite and happy.\n\nThe fries are something to be talked about: thin, crispy, and not greasy. Perfect with a sandwich or as a side for a snack. Helpings are more than average-sized so if you're not too hungry, sharing is caring, as my kids would say.
COMFORT FOOD WITH A TWIST! Oh my this place is phenomenal! Try the Pork Paprikash, it won't disappoint. Everything on the menu is excellent. The service is awesome! Their drinks are tastes & natural. Definitely a great place for a date night!!
Wir warren zu 4rt und fur 30 euro super sat gegessen.ich finde echt gut.shade dass es keins im Zentrum gibt
You know, if I look back on it I haven't had a Chick-fil-A experience I didn't like. This is my choice location and it's like the diamond in the rough surrounded by mostly par and sub-par restaurants in this area.\n\nChick-fil-A has certainly weathered the storm when it comes to the fall of fast food these days. Yeah, their food is still fast and relatively similar to the rest in that it's fried, greasy and fattening. But they've added a few other options to their menu. There's of course your generic fresh fruit cup but they now have a few kinds of soup which are quite good in my opinion. Additionally, in case it wasn't advertised enough already, they've got grilled chicken alternatives for just about every fried chicken menu item. You may have misgivings about eating grilled chicken here but I swear to you: it's good. I'm also a huge fan of their cookies & cream milkshake. And let's face it, who isn't a fan of their fresh squeezed delectable lemonade?\n\nThe food is good and everyone knows it. But the service? It's above and beyond anything we've come to know for fast food. You will always ALWAYS have a pleasant experience at any Chick-fil-A. If you don't, call them or e-mail them to say so and they will absolutely make it right. This location is no exception. You won't leave here feeling bothered, frustrated, worried about spit in your meal or pissed off in general. In fact you should almost always leave here exactly the opposite: practically uplifted. The prices may be only a thin hair higher than those of competitor fast food chains but for the level of service I'd choose Chick-fil-A any day. Now I just need some places like Wendy's or Cook Out to hop on the stellar service bandwagon so I can get the other things I love to eat without feeling like all is lost for humanity.
The saloon's wing night is great. It's a great place to watch sporting events and the staff is always very friendly. \n\nThey lose a star based on the french fries. Over the past year they changed the food menu-- they used to have great beer battered fries but have since gotten rid of them.
Just finished eating at the saloon. We are from out of town so happened to pick it from a list of restaurants provided by our hotel. We found it to be wonderful. Enjoying a Sunday night with football on television, delicious food, and great drinks. We just had sandwiches, nothing fancy but everything was so fresh and the French fries were tasty. I could have ordered a basket of the fries and been very happy. For a couple of tourists, after 6 hours of driving, it was just what we wanted.
I ordered the hamburger it was awesome and the potato fries that they do were so good it was really quick didn't have to wait very long for the order and the atmosphere is really nice.
As always, this place delivers on food quality and service;  Had a yummy short-rib enchilada and the server was very nice!  Only complaint is that the enchilada was tough on the bottom ..maybe overcooked?  Still, it was delicous and nicely presented with a side salad.  HB is still one of my favorite places to dine....interesting menu choices.
Have come many times. Service getting worse. Never got saki. Dish had tufu when I did not order. Replacement dish had no flavor. Will not be back.
My dining experience here was probably the worst dining experience I've ever had. Our waitress completely forgot our appetizer and ended up bringing it with our meal. She apologized when she brought it out saying my food was being remade because they added something I didn't ask for. She finally brought my meal out but this time it had tofu in it. Once again the order was wrong she said \"I didn't know you were allergic to tofu\" well guess what?! The menu said NOTHING about tofu being added. Round three, she didn't include the peanuts in my pad Thai which she later brought and sat the dish right in the middle of my food. The check came and she said \"I gave you a 15% discount\"  A whole $1.89 off my bill even with everything being completely wrong. We asked to speak to a manager who wouldn't even listen to our experience, she walked away from our table. This is completely unacceptable. Save your money and go somewhere that is actually decent.
Most definitely one of the top 3 restaurants in Madison. The chef-owner, Gil, is truly gifted and you should try his small plates. His dishes are conceived with taste and freshness and beauty in mind.\n\nThe seasonal \"Charred ramps\" was FANTASTIC. (Ramps are wild spring onions.) Ramps with slight char, served on a board with fried anchovies, a fried egg and a few cherry tomatoes. It was sort of like a deconstructed Caesar salad, but made with sweet charred onions. Amazing.\n\nThe beet salad - well-described in other reviews was stunning and Delish.\n\nThe dumplings, stuffed with chicken, were topped with a round of fois gras! Served with a light broth and a sprinkle of watercress. Oh yum.\n\nThe pork confit was served in a smokin' hot cast-iron skillet, so that the roasted pork got slightly crispy on the bottom. This came with stone-ground mustard, crusty bread and a jalapeno pickle salad. Heaven.\n\nThe chocolate mousse, with coffee and cardamom was the lightest I have had in many years. \nServed with caramel tuilles - a gorgeous presentation.\n\nThey have a great wine list- too - with CMS as their house wine.\n\nYou could go here for beer and pizza - but why?\n\nThe service was perfect. Serious, well-timed and impeccable.\n\nGrampa's is very small. Therefore, you have to go early to get a table or be prepared to wait next door at Gib's (the house bar next door).
I love being able to build your own burger and eat sweet potato fries! I love all the options available to you while eating and my daughter loves the kids menu too!
I haven't been here for sometime and thought I'd go back since going to a movie. I had the Kobe burger and it was very good. I like the fact you can build your own burger to how you like it and it's a good size burger. Service was good as well and like the fact that the movie theater is walking distance.
Burgers were standard.  Service was sub-par.  I won't go back again.  Nothing really great about the experience at all.  Burgers weren't that tasty.
What a gem of a restaurant! I knew something was up when there was a wait for a table for lunch after 1 pm!!-sat at the bar and tried the flatbread pizza(capicola and artichoke) which was amazingly good. Returned the next day for dinner with 5 others-loved the grilled salmon with curried chickpeas and cauliflower. The hummus/tzatziki appetizer with olives was delicious and large enough to share with all! My friends meals included roasted chicken, Thai BBQ ribs, pork chops and squash enchiladas which were all excellent. Friendly service and great atmosphere-one of my new favorites...I highly recommend this restaurant.
DO NOT SPEND MONEY here. Was just informed the night before Mother's Day that my reservation could no longer be accommodated as requested. When the manager got on the phone he did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. He said it got filled up a week ago, so why was I only called the night before then? Then when I said I was extremely unhappy with his argumentative tone over the phone and that I would def write a review he said \"it's probably best that you DONT dine with us\" and the only way he'd guarantee my reservation at that point was with a credit card. It really is a shame that you will lose me as a customer after frequenting your restaurants for many years.
Today was the second time I ate at the Herb Box.  Both times, I biked there from my house (about 7 miles).  The ride is completely worth it. \nThe restaurant is nestled in the sleepy Market Street shopping center near DC Ranch. They have a great patio with large umbrellas and power misters.  \n\nEverything we have tried on the menu is best in its class.  Today we had red velvet pancakes.  They were amazing and came with yummy bacon.  We also had the pork and egg chilaquiles.  SOOO GOOD. \n\nThis restaurant is reasonably priced.  I plan on going there every Sunday that i have available.  Bravo!
A friend and I had lunch at The Herb Box today after checking out the reviews on Yelp.  The restaurant is charming and located in the beautiful DC Ranch area. \n\nWe sat on the patio which was nicely cooled with misters. Our service was very good.  It was a Sunday afternoon and there was a good crowd but we were greeted and served promptly. Our waitress checked on us regularly and we always had our tea and water glasses filled (which I think is always a sign of good service).\n\nI had the Coconut Shrimp Salad and my friend had the Butternut Squash Enchiladas. We both enjoyed our meals. My salad had a lot of flavor and was very fresh. The presentation of the food was beautiful, too.\n\nThe menu is diverse but a little pricier than a typical lunch. However, the food and atmosphere was worth it. \n\nWill definitely be back.
Awesome authentic Korean food.  We came today and had the stone pot bulgogi rice, the tofu soup, galbi, another order of Bulgogi, and fried dumplings.  Everything was done to perfection.  Banchan was also decent.  They kimchee had great flavor.  I will definitely be back!
I already can't wait to go back to GOGI and try more things on their menu. So yummy!!!  Hubby and a friend went with the pork and bulgogi hot stone bowl. I'm pretty sure the bowls were about 10 inches in diameter, so definitely huge portions. More importantly, it was delicious (hubby allowed me a bite) and I loved how the rice got a little crispy from the heat of the bowl. I went with the spicy squid and pork belly and was in heaven!!  They also brought out a bunch of sides which came with the meal - fish cake, radish, potato, kimchi...awesome variety!!  We went on a Friday night right around 5 and were only one of a couple small groups within the restaurant. By 5:30, the place was packed, so I recommend going early. Next time, hot pot is on my list to try!!
This is my fav Korean spot in town. They're closed on Mondays so it's hard to get a chance to stop in. My favorite is their hot stone bibimbap soon tofu combo. It's nicely air conditioned with plenty of tables. It seats big parties which is great cus we have family that always comes into town.
I'm so happy Coco is now open downtown Toronto. I've tried their drinks a couple times and everytime I ordered something different cuz I want try all the selections they have in the top 10 list. 4 down and 6 more to go! Can't wait for my next visit to Coco! Btw, all 4 of the drinks I had were XXXcellent!
There is nothing else like this Buffett. \n\nIt has essentially everything you can think of it crave for a all inclusive dinner. We have went there for birthdays, dinners and even Christmas and haven't been disappointed. \n\nI would suggest making a reservation as the wait can be pretty long at points.
Super Lecker war es hier. Ich habe in Toronto gelebt und meine Studienkollegen haben mich hier her ausgef\u00fchrt. Ich fands super. Das Buffet ist der Hammer. Alles sehr lecker. Man bekommt Leitungswasser bis zum abwinken - wer nicht auf Chlorgeschmack steht, sollte sich ein Getr?nk in der Fl bestellen. \nAuf jeden Fall ein Besuch wert!
Watch you don't get shanked by the servers, not really personable! You'll get the evil eye if you order something out of the norm!  Great job parkhurst!  Makes me think twice on eat n park after seeing this monstrosity!
We came here with two other couples to celebrate our wedding day. When our server found out we had just gotten married he surprised us all with a glass of champagne -Yay! The parmesan popovers were so delicious that I could have just ate that all night and been happy! My husband ordered the parm herb crusted veal chop and it was juicy and wonderful with garlic mash. I ordered the 16 oz striploin and it was cooked to perfection. The service could not have been better and the ambience was very romantic and relaxing which was the perfect end to our amazing day. We cannot wait to go back in the future!
Canastitas buenisimas. La mejor es la parrillera. Y las pizzas xl para grupos van bien
First time eating there with my family and it was pretty good esp the sandwiches and the customer service is good friendly people
Just tried this pizza for the first time....although I have lived in the neighborhood 7 yrs...   The picture they have on their brochure depicts a nicely browned and bubbly pizza reflecting lots of cheese that actually looked like cheese...\n\nUnfortunately the actual pizza looks absolutely nothing like the picture...I ordered a pepperoni pizza and there was 2 slices that had 2  pieces of pepperoni and the rest  had one little pepperoni on each slice.\n\nThe pizza is very doughy....the toppings are sparse and the cheese is a paper thin layer that resembles a dominoes or papa john type....\n\n.In essence....for $7.40 appox for a 1 topping pizza it will do when you just crave pizza and have little funds ...\n\nRemember....you get what you pay for!   \n\nI do have to compliment them on the quaint eating area ....just a few tables but very homey feeling.....very nice employees.\n\nI am not sure if I will try it again....
I tried, I really tried. I wanted to like Two Men and a Pizza. \nClever name, close, independently owned.  I called them because I got a flyer on my door and they had a great special, 14 inch cheese pie for $5.00.  When I found the place it was small, clean and the person at the register was nice.  He told me all about their other offering, wings, sandwiches, deserts.  I love supporting small, family owned pizza joints. \nWhen I got my pie I was excited to get it home and try it. \n\nOne thing I do not like about pizza is when the crust is soft and chewy.   I like a crisp crust.  So a few weeks later I thought, \"Well maybe I just should have specified\" that I like it \"Well Done\"  so I thought I would try it again.  my order came to $12.50 for a pizza AND 10 wings.  What a deal!  Only this time the crust was even more chewy and soft then before.  Very disappointed.  They are very nice people. \nPerhaps I will try a sub sandwich from there sometime. \n\nBut I am done with their pizza.
I was wandering around downtown Madison today and ended up here for lunch.  Typical Mexican food outside of LA .... sorry I have been come biased since I have moved to LA years ago.  It gets a star for a lunch menu with most items $6.99.  The food was better than expected for that price.  I was disappointed with the sangria, but I think that might be I am a wine snob and don't like drinks made out of wine - so no deduction for that.
Is it normal to wait for a smoothie for over 15 minutes when there are only 2 tables filled with people in the entire place? Service was super disappointing and no apology was even given after having to have waited so long to get served for takeout. It almost felt as the priority there was given to the staff socializing amongst each other instead of putting customers first. On another note after having waited this long my smoothie was watered down and bitter...I was in a rush so I just left. Other than this the food is always great at your other locations but the attitude needs to be worked on at this specific location.
What a jewel!  Great cider selection and beer selection. Lots of out door seating which is perfect.  Hopping with lots of singles, families and dogs. Bigger than you think. Adding it to one of our regular spots.
Old Chain Pier, Leith Edinburgh! Started with the Cullin Skink Soup, which is a cream, potatoe and fish 'chowder' of sorts and absolutely divine on this cold day in January. Coupled with an amber ale, and bread, I couldn't be happier. Also, Vicky was helping me and she was soooooo nice and hospitable. Excellent atmosphere and food. Worth the travel or a swing by! I had the Shepard's Pie as my main- delicious!! If I live here it come back, this will be my main spot!!
This place has been on my bucket list for the past few month's based on Yelp reviews.  Not sure that my first visit was quite 4 stars, maybe 3.5.   A co-worker and I stopped here for lunch on a Tuesday afternooon.  The place was empty when we arrived, but slowly started to fill up, after we sat down.  I had previewed the menu on-line and opted for the chicken salad sandwich and side of Tabbouleh.  My co-worker ordered a salad and 1 choc chip pancake (lol!).  Our meals arrived a short time later.  My sandwich was tasty, the bun was fresh, although the chicken salad lacked just a little something, maybe some tarragon?  Just needed a little more flavor.  The tabbouleh lacked a lot of flavor, very watery, needed some lemon and a bit more seasoning.  I did however taste my co-worker's pancake and it was outstanding.  All in all, I will return to try some of the other options.
I had Pheul for the first time today while judging a scholastic contest at CIA today. Since they were providing lunch, I didn't what to expect (but it's Cleveland, and we have amazing food, so I wasn't stressed) \nI was very impressed with their chicken salad sandwich as well as the amazing kale salad. I don't think I've ever eaten kale cold before but this salad had some citrus as well as something sweet in it. I would eat it again in a heartbeat! I will be going back to Pheul very soon :)
Terrible service, expired - tasting ingredients, and tragic flavors. It's an ideal place for you to take your boy/girlfriend if you wanna breakup and hate each other for every second in the rest of your life.
Clean restaurant and friendly staff, but what I liked about this location is the fact that I had a coupon from the App that was originally to get a free $6 thickburger.  When I came in the app ended up getting updated and it is now a buy one get one free.  They honored the original which was very nice and they didn't have to do it.
Stopped in here as it was close to my hotel.  Great local pub. Service was great, food was definitely above average. Would recommend the wings for sure. Will be back next time I'm in town.
Quick service, large portions.  One Roll can feed two.  Quick get in and out when you are tight for a connector.  Hissho Sushi is the actual Sushi Bar at that location.
Tr\u00e8s bon emplacement, facile de se rendre et de stationner, en auto ou en autobus. Il y a une machine de popcorn. Oui, du popcorn gratuit. \u00e0 volont\u00e9!!! Je capotais ! (Je pense qu'ils l'ont encore mais je suis pas all\u00e9e r\u00e9cemment donc je suis pas sure). Je trouve que l'ambiance est super le fun, le prix est assez bien et la qualit\u00e9 de la nourriture est satisfaisante. Le menu offre des pates, de la viande, des ailes de poulet, etc. Il y a donc de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9, mais plus de choix rendraient le menu encore mieux. Le service est assez bon !
I'm so hungry today I need something good , just order ribeye with potatoes . Omg the flavor was so good , the meat tender and juice , just perfect .
Great food\nDon't let the exterior fool you this place has great service and excellent food. Support this business
Get the lobster artichoke dip and get orange ginger shrimp tacos. DO IT.\n\nNow on to the actual review: Came here after reading this blog http://discoveringcleveland.com/ and found a very nice, cozy place! The wait staff was attentive and helpful, bar deals were great, and we all very much enjoyed our food. If you do come here after a Monsters game, make sure you save your ticket stub--they advertised a 15% discount for people with Monsters tickets. We were going before the game and were buying tickets there/had flash seats, so we couldn't use the discount :( I expect they'd do the same for Cavs games and possibly Indians games? \n\nThe local flair given to most of the menu items was rather fun as well. The names of the sandwiches and burgers are clever and include great ingredients like the Dortmunder Gold beer. They also work to use items in season--the ahi tuna wasn't available, but they were substituting Lake Erie walleye and they offered us brussel sprouts instead of asparagus, but the food was still delicious!\n\nDefinitely want to come back to try their other options and enjoy the homey atmosphere!
Their doors are closed and furnishings are gone.  No warning or anything.  They seem to have just packed up and left.  I'll miss them.
This restaurant is awesome. They provide both vegan & gluten free menus - as a vegan, having options is awesome! They have special drink deals during NFL games & half off appetizers during happy hour. They have quite a few tvs for sports fans. Last time we were in Vegas, we went 4 times because it was so good!! Their vegan meatball sub sandwich is fantastic.
It was great to see that this place had vegan options.  The vegan pizza and sandwich were actually very tasty.  Just beware that if you order from the counter, that you must sit at the counter seats.  This was not specified when we ordered so we had to find seating downstairs with tables.
Have been waiting for several months and Finally They Are Back In Business with new management ! Ordered to go & was soooo good that my Bf & I didn't get to our phones fast enough.  We had the Tokyo Roll, California Roll, Shrimp Roll, Wasa Tako (octopus with fresh wasabi & daikon) and the Shima Aji Jalape?o (Jalape?o yellowtail  cilantro, yuzu dressing) everything was delicious & fresh.
A nice surprise for the area, excellent sushi, great service, good value. We will be regulars from now on!
Hands down, best pancakes I have ever had. I would wait three hours for those babies! Went on a Sunday, waited almost 2 hours and boy was it worth it. I would suggest going on a weekday early morning to avoid the wait but I promise you will be glad you waited! You can also do take out. Oh, and get the orange juice!
Oh my god. My first experience at MBB was on Good Friday, and it made it an Awesome Friday. The bacon was one of the more memorable things. Thick and cooked perfectly. Oh! And that delicious Honey Lemonade. Such a quaint little spot. Cute, small restaurant makes it feel small-town. The wait wasn't too bad either, but, I haven't been on the weekend yet. \nCan't wait to go again!
This place is good.  Has a decent burger  and  fries , worth the 15 bucks for a soda , fries and burger . That's reasonable for Las Vegas prices
I was fairly disappointed. The burger was mediocre, maybe a little thicker than a typical burger at a Wendy's, and I asked for a little ketchup and mustard on mine and it was absolutely slobbered in it... At least they were being generous instead of skimpy, right? Pricing was pretty poor too- I got a burger fries and a soda and it worked out to over $14; keeping in mind this is a fast food burger place. I won't be going back, unfortunately.
Dropped by for their happy hour. All of their cocktails were great, and only $6! They make them with some fairly high quality alcohol as well, which is a plus. The service is splendid, and the atmosphere is great for a post-dinner rendezvous over meticulously made cocktails.
I've eaten at and enjoyed Michael Mina's restaurants in San Francisco and wanted to go out with my sister and her husband while spending a few days in Vegas.  Knowing Mina's reputation I felt this restaurant would be a real treat and must say I was severely disappointed.....disappointed enough to sign up for yelp specifically to write this review.\n\nThe good points (earning this the one star instead of -2).  Nice fresh-out-of-the-oven-bread served.  Waiter was pleasant and tried to help us with our complaints later.  End of good points.\n\nThe food was overpriced and deplorable.  I had the monkfish for $38.  The portion of fish on my plate could not have been more than 3 ounces which was mostly bone.  I managed to scrape a small amount of fish off the bone which was slightly overcooked and very bland.  There was what may have amounted to a tablespoon of some type of mushroom scattered around the plate and a small cast iron pan of pinto beans on the side which tasted like the worst canned beans I've ever had and \"spiced up\" with what could only have been a half cup of salt.\n\nMy sister had the $35 salmon, which was of smaller than average size and according to her tasted \"OK, but nothing special\".  This was the third time she had had a salmon dish on our trip (twice in SF) and was the worst of the three and at least $10 more expensive.\n\nMy brother-in-law had the only fairly priced and edible dish of the three of us.  A $20 Kobe beef burger with enough fries to fill up both my sister's and my still growling stomachs.  I had steered away from the burger for \"something special\", sadly this was probably the best thing on the menu.\n\nWhen we told our waiter of our dissatisfaction, he went to the managers to see if he could do something (again, he was the only highlight of the evening besides the bread).;  The managers took one look at us and figured we weren't Vegas regulars and decided immediately not to do anything to make us feel a little less taken advantage of......this is the modus operandi of the restaurant.  They know they have an unlimited supply of first-time rubes to come in and get fleeced once...they do not need to rely on repeat customers.  If this restaurant were located in San Francisco it wouldn't last 2 months....but in Vegas it is able to feed unsuspecting tourists crappy food based on the name of a well known chef for years on end...\n\nIf Michael Mina reads this I would suggest he investigate the restaurant that he seems to have lost control of, his SF restaurants are excellent and this place can only serve to destroy his reputation.  I would hope that he is not implicit in this ruse and simply view this as a cash cow instead of worrying about his reputation.  I have had many meals at many restaurants around the US and Europe.  I have no problem paying good money for good food, but I felt like this place was simply set up to fleece unsuspecting tourists.  I would stay far away from this place, and if you happen to find yourself there right now...do yourself a favor and forget the \"something special\" on the menu and go for the $20 burger...you'll be the only one not feeling completely ripped off and your dinner mates can at least sustain themselves from your enormous portion of fries...
Absolute surprise and great find! We were looking for a place to eat and my kids wanted pizza. To our delight not only did they have pizza for one child (really good size portion for kids menu), some of the best mac 'n cheese I've ever had. Plus I had their Antipasto salad and my husband a sandwich. We loved it so much we grabbed a few slices one evening after hanging out in the pool. (You can get it by the slice  - but I recommend if you are gonna need a whole pizza order ahead. It takes 15 -20 min. or they overcharge for by the slice.)
I am another who does not understand the hype about this diner. I have been there twice.  I have had the waffles and hash browns.   The waffles were soggy and the hash browns were very greasy (both times).  I could have done that at home without the 45 minute wait.  Plus, the coffee is putrid.
this place is near my office , and when im craving good Mexican food  this where i go !!!!
Amazing! Three tacos. Barbacoa beef, red chili chicken and Carne Asada. I've never had Mexican food this good. Be careful of the Green Chili Chicken. It brings tears to your eyes.
First time visiting today - shrimp street tacos were awesome.  There was a line as other reviewers had mentioned for lunch - so FYI.\nIt's dangerous that this place is so close to work.  Can't wait to come back and try more!
Great amount of variety that all looked great. I ordered the sopes and they were great. The green chili chicken was spicy but had so much yummy flavor. The red chicken was good, and the traditional carnitas was good as well but the green chili chicken was the best out of the three. \nService was friendly and fast\nThe place is pretty small but has a really fun atmosphere. \nWould defiantly be going back for more!
I just got back from another delicious meal at Dumpling King, and can not fathom how this restaurant got some of the negative reviews that it did.  I live in New York, so I am used to good quality Chinese food.  My son's friend recommended Dumpling King so we decided to give it a try. I am always leery about trying new places, but am s glad I did. From start to finish the food has been delicious. Fresh, tasty, hot from the kitchen and reasonably priced. I couldn't ask for more. The owner, Merry, is lovely and speaks English beautifully, so if you have any questions she will be more than happy to answer them. Some of the dishes we enjoyed were the potstickers, beef dumplings, brisket, sweet and sour beef, and fried noodles with chicken. The bill for all that food for four people was $60 with lots to bring home! The decor is festive and bright. If you are expecting Panda Express, then you are in the wrong place. If you are looking for a good, high-quality meal then go to Dumpling King. You won't be sorry.
Excellent breakfast spot - but get there early (like, at 8am) before the line-up gets too long. The small space fills up not only with people, but with hunger-inducing aromas of baked goods - I think I gained 3 pounds just from these sweet scents alone! Coffee is bottomless and I was never without a full steaming mug, thanks to the attentive staff. I had the Croque Madam - ham and gruyere on brioche topped with a fried egg. It was balanced well by the light side salad. Though I thought I wouldn't be able to finish the baguette on the side, but it tasted so much like my grandmother's baked bread from the village, in the end, I wanted more. Got chocolate croissants to go for a mid-morning snack later on. I love this place and would go back in an instant.
For any of you that have been to Matt's and don't like it, no offense, but we wouldn't make a good breakfast eating team. \n\nBecause I love it. I had read and heard many a glowing review of this place from friends but the lingering question in the back of my mind was \"How can bacon, toast, and eggs be that good?\" Candidly, I still don't know the answer to that question. What I do know, however, is that it is, indeed, that good, if not better than I ever dreamed simple breakfast foods could be. \n\nThe line can be a formidable obstacle. There is a pad on top of the water by the front door where people write in the name of their party and number of people and you just wait for them to call your name into the tiny restaurant. I saw quite a few people outside, content to be waiting with a book, obviously knowing what they had in store.\n\nAs for the \"too much butter\" complaint from other reviewers, my advice is don't worry about it. If you want a light breakfast, Matt's isn't what you're looking for. For an obscenely delicious plate exploding with flavor and goodness, bring a book and post up at Matt's. It's worth it.
Midwestern hipster breakfast of champions - that's how I would describe it in 5 words.  \n\nGood down-home breakfast, but not for weight watchers.   Bright orange formica counters and rooster orange juice glasses.  Love that the place is smaller than a shoebox.  It means you have wait ahead of you, but it keeps the breakfast experience a friendly intimate one. \n\nThe hog and chick is what I usually order. But most recently I've been ordering the sopressata salami scramble with provolone and the five spot breakfast sandwich.  The burger buns are a lackluster choice, but the grilled onions and thick peppercorn bacon slices more than make up for it.  The hash browns can be a bit greasy, but hey, that's what happens when you cook with butter.  \n\nCan be a wait on weekend, but worth it in central Phoenix, especially when the Good Egg and other places get old.
My favorite breakfast place for breakfast. Try the hog and chick . Daily specials are sure to please
Ok, so first for the bad: \nSo the first time I went there was when some friends invited me.\nThey were already at the restaurant, I was still in bed at home in Avondale. I showered, dressed and drove over there...they were still waiting for a table. In fact once I got there we waited another 30 minutes for a table. that means my friends were waiting over an hour and a half for a table.\nMy other complaint is that my potatoes are always too burnt, even when I tell them not to burn them.\nThey are closed on Monday (you would have thought I would remember this the first two Monday;s I came to eat here)\nSo now for the good:\nEverything else! I love the food!\nThe Chop & Chick and griddle cakes are my fave for breakfast and for lunch I love...well just about everything!\nCan't wait till I move back so I can go again!!
There will be a line ... you will wait - probably for an hour ... and you'll be happy you did. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The burger was one of the best I have ever had. \n\nDon't let the appearance of the building scare you off. Make it happen. This place lives up to the hype.
Excellent food and service. I loved that they use all natural fresh ingredients from local farms. The place is small so get there early on the weekend if you want to avoid the wait and I don't think they have a bathroom so get that sorted before going. I was very happy with the overall experience and  I would  highly recommend a visit.
The workers here often like to decide that they \"don't take card payments\" so that they can turn people away when they're feeling lazy (which apparently is pretty often). Super unprofessional.
I went to Bocca one night and it was great! I love this place. Such a nice, quiet place to sit down and have a glass of vino, some great conversation, and some great food. \n\nI was here with my godmother to do some much-needed catching up and this was the perfect place. We started out with the grilled black tiger shrimp. For my main, I had the chicken and sun dried tomato ravioli and my godmother had the osso bucco. No room for dessert- the portions were huge and quite satisfying.\n\nHere are my thoughts:\nGrilled black tiger shrimp- so good! The shrimps were fairly large, which was great. Some places claim to have \"tiger shrimps\" and they seem to fall short, but Bocca definitely delivered on this claim. \n\nChicken and sun dried tomato ravioli- the rose sauce on this was amazing. Perfect consistency. Just the right amount of cheese. Tasted great with some chili flakes sprinkled on top, but I do like a good amount of heat on my food.\n\nOsso bucco- I'm a chicken-person, so when I tried the veal, I was expecting not to like it, but it was amazing! It was so tender and the white wine and tomato sauce was really good. The mushroom risotto was also a nice touch. I do like my dishes al dente, which the risotto was. Perfect!\n\nWine: our waitress did a great job pairing a white with our meal. I can't recall what it was, but I know that it do go well with the food. \n\nBocca is in Baldwin Village. Great neighbour and great atmosphere. If you want something quiet, romantic, and nice, definitely hit this place up!
Twice I have been in Edinburgh in the past 3 months and twice we have gone to Rivage only to find it closed with no sign as to why. I walked by the evening before and the place was busy. Their sign outside and brochure found at the hotel say they are open 7 days. At least they could put up some indication as to why they are closed.
We had a going away party at OKRA yest.  The staff at OKRA was remarkable. The manager Maureen did a phenomenal job in accommodation all our needs. She interacted with us and always made sure we were all having a good time. OKRA was definitely the perfect place for any special occasion. We had an amazing time and will return. Thank you guys so much!
Sandwiches were fantastic! Portions were good. Service was friendly. My only minor complaint was that they don't have a soda fountain. They sell all their beverages in cans.
Don't ever eat here. We walked in Saturday morning. There were about 10 tables open on the patio. We told hostess we wanted to sit outside and she said 15 minutes.  Why I have no idea except she was trying to load up her friends section instead of seating open tables.  Told her to piss off and we went to IHOP across the street. Sat immediately and awesome food.
First visit here after using the other pizza place in Estrella for a few years. First the positive. The Margarita panini was decent. The chips that came with it were rubbery and old, very chewy like a doggie treat in a bag, threw them out. The entire pizza had maybe 1 teaspoon of tomato sauce on the whole pie. It was just cheese and crust, too dry. If I want cheese and crackers I can get that elsewhere. The crust was decent compared to most but overall the pizza as created was lousy. I can't tell if the kid behind the register was Beavis or Butthead but wow good help is hard to find. I guess you have figured out I won't be going back and will return to the other pizza place by the gas station.
I love this place!!  I was looking for a nice coffee house/ bakery near Ikea.  This had everything that I was hoping for.  A great atmosphere & super friendly staff!  We worked with Tiana and she was a true delight.  Beautiful from the inside out and so helpful and accommodating.  I loved the Mocah iced coffee that I ordered.  Half caf, almond milk and half the sugar.  It was perfect.  I love that they offer Soy, Coconut Milk and Almond Milk for those that don't want dairy.  Ambiance was great and they serve coffee and drinks in cute mason jars.  The pastries and baked goods looked delish and they have bakers that show up early every morning to bake everything FRESH and IN HOUSE.  I also got the Lemon, Chocolate and Strawberry French Macaroons. YUMMY.   We can't wait to go back and next time, I'm brining more friends.  THANK YOU to the owner, Emily for being a true light.  Kind, hard working and giving us a lovely place with great food and drink options.
Came here with some friends for lunch. So delicious. The chicken salad was phenomenal, and the croissant was fresh. The brownie was also BOMB! My friends loved their meals. The decor is so cute- totally the kind of place you can cuddle up with a book and a coffee and treat for a few hours- and not as loud as Starbucks. Staff was so sweet and attentive. Can't wait to come back!
Met some friends here for breakfast this morning and was immediately reminded why, during the 8 years I spent in Kent, I only went here once.  This place would be great as a museum or antique shop, but as a restaurant?  No.  \n\nLike other reviewers have said the menu is the size of an encyclopedia, which, while funny, should be your first warning sign.  I'd imagine it's difficult to keep that many different ingredients within the expiration date, let alone anywhere near \"fresh.\"  And it tastes like it.  The running joke has always been this is the place to come to if you want diarrhea (see what I did there?) and that joke exists for a reason.  \n\nYes, they do have a giant X-Wing outside.  They get points for that.  The best thing about the place is the huge assortment of random, kitschy stuff that fills every nook, cranny, and corner of the restaurant.  While this is the greatest strength, it's also a pretty big weakness.  All the antiques are great, but the whole place just feels...filthy.  Seriously.  Maybe it's all the grease oozing out from the kitchen, but it just feels dirty.  I'm not one of those people that needs a restaurant to be spotless, either.  I know the cleanliness of the dining area doesn't always reflect the quality of the food.  Here, though, the two pretty much go hand in hand.  And don't get me started on the bathroom.  \n\nOur server was friendly and I will say that there's really nowhere else quite like Mike's Place.  Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing.....\n\nGo and have a beer or two just to see the place and say you've been there.  Then go eat somewhere else.
Here's a quick summation of the good, the bad, and the ugly:\n\nThe good:\n- 5 BBQ sauce options - including the Georgia Mustard BBQ sauce.\n- Cornbread - for the love of all that is holy there seems to be a fight for the cornbread everytime!\n- St. Louis Style Rib - fall off the bone good.\n\nThe bad:\n- Hot Links are not made fresh, and taste like something that can be bought at the market.\n- The side dishes - the hot sides like mac 'n cheese, baked beans, and green beans never seem to come out of the kitchen hot, warn, or slightly above room temperature.\n- 5 BBQ sauce options - there seems to be BBQ sauce residue all over the tables, booths, floor, and any other place that a kid would have chosen to wipe their hands instead of a napkin.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Brisket:  often times very dry and void of its own flavor.\n- Texas toast - I just don't like it in any form, but there's is especially not good.\n- Everytime I leave I almost wish that Chi-Chi's would reopen in this location.
I wen to the store to buy 5 chess burgers around 11 pm ! I got my entire meal late and cold!i call back the guy say to return the burgers to exchange almost mid night with my kids hungry they all ready finish the burger!!i he say to came back another day to get a new ones but thad never happen cause  the    Gm was not there I spend 45 min to give a not till the gm was there thad I have to came back on Friday to speak with him!!!that's so ridiculously please don't bother buying their is not personal capable to handle anything!!!!!!!!
Great place for a nice glass of wine and a fantastic dinner. Downtown Cleveland suffers a bit from lack of nice evening dining. This place is centrally located and the menu is top notch. Michael Symon the chef has created a little gem in the heart of Brown's country. \n\nThe bartenders are great even when they collide rushing in for fast service.
We went to Lola a couple weeks back and have not stopped talking about it.  We absolutely loved it and will definitely be back!\n\nStarted with the Charcuterie platter with a glass of wine at the bar while waiting for our table (we were early and were sat right on time).  After sitting down we had one of the most amazing appetizers of all time- the Crispy Bone Marrow!  What a combination of flavor and texture.  So rich!  For entrees we had the Lamb Shank and the Cavatelli.\n\nGreat job Michael!
Average chain restaurant trying to be disgusted as a micro brew pub!  Service was very slow and although I wanted to like our waitress Amber, she did a mediocre job at best.  My beer should not stay empty for over ten minutes before asking if I want another.  Several tables seated after us received their food before we did.  There are carpet runners throughout entire place because the tile floor is so slippery.  Menu is large and my Mahi Mahi tacos were extremely good, unfortunately the chips that came with were swimming in grease and a big let down.  What really put me over the edge of not wanting to go back was the wannabe hipster manager with the beard that walked out from the kitchen chewing on food and wiping his mouth while carrying some customers food, very gross and borderline disgusting!  The decor at first glance looks great but after you sit for a few minutes you notice everything is so fake and a really cheaply done.  The fake brick wall paper, is well, fake brick wall paper.  Very cheesy!  I am really let down because I was so looking forward to going.  Pricing was reasonable, although I'd rather pay a few dollars more and go to a real micro brew pub.
We've been anxiously awaiting another dining option after Smokey Bones closed so we tried BJ's for lunch only a few days after opening. First impressions were bland. The restaurant was loud and somewhat overcompensating on staff. (I don't need a refill on my drink when it is 3/4 full). We had pretty much counted this one out after our food took forever, however once it did we changed our mind.  We ordered a burger for me (no bun, declined the gf free bun) and he got the pulled pork. I will say that was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. It was a bit greasy, but I was not ordering a burger to be healthy anyway. My husband really enjoyed the pulled pork and we both loved the fries. The prices were reasonable and we left happy. I will probably wait awhile until the staff is better trained, but I will definitely be back.
i'm looking forward to Pizza Fire opening in Fairlawn (close to work) and Strongsville (close to home). \nToday Danielle and I went to the Cuyahoga Falls location and tried it for the first time, and I think I'm in love. \nDanielle had a 1-topping pizza (tomato) w/ fresh mozzarella and roasted garlic and oil. she had said it could use some salt or even more sauce but it was good. \nI had a 3-topping pizza (tuscan pepperoni, banana pepper and mushrooms) w/ the spicy Neapolitan sauce. I loved the crispy crust. the toppings were delicious (though the mushrooms were not at all \"fresh\" - they were clearly canned). the sauce was spicy but not too much so. had we not also gotten the PizzaFire breadsticks i could have easily eaten another pizza. \nthere are salads, gluten-free crusts and vegan cheese also for those who have chosen to jump on those trends.\nlike i said, i look forward to this place opening in Fairlawn (wherever/whenever) that might be. it's going to be a huge hit with my coworkers as well.
I am a big fan....For 2012 I am going to really try to eat healthier so I will be in here more often. The food is always tasty and unique. I love the happy hour because drinks are half priced.
5 street tacos is where its at.  May have to parlay 5 tacos into 10 just to try them all.\nof course not all will be winners depending on your taste in tacos, but try them all.\n\nword.
Abseits der Theodor-Heuss-Stra?e eine sehr feine Cocktail-Bar. Man sitzt auf schicken wei?en Polsterw\u00fcrfeln oder auf Kissen im Schaufenster und trinkt einen Cocktail nach dem anderen. Zumindest wenn man wie ich nur die alkoholfreien trinkt, und die sind sehr gut. Musik kommt vom DJ, trotzdem hat das ganze etwas gem\u00fctliches und ruhiges.
Okay so I was promised a milkshake at a bowling alley last night and it turns out they didn't have any.... SO.... I decided that tonight I must get one!  I Google Searched for where I can get a nice milkshake in Montreal and this place came up.  Amelie and I went there and she got the pecan pie (the apple pie looked amazing too!) and I got a Cappuccino Milkshake (they also had Amaretto, Chocolate, Mocha, Strawberry, Vanilla etc...)  It was GREAT!  The restaurant was very clean and modern-looking.  We had a nice time and will be back again!
Very busy due to dinner rush.  Somewhat of a loud environment, we had to talk louder than usual at the cashier for them to hear our order.  Time from order to food on our table was relatively quick.  We got a burger (saut\u00e9ed onions, fried onion strings, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles) and plain hot dog, both were amazing.  Fries are on point, fresh.  A bit pricy however it's worth it.  Food looked amazing and was delicious!
This place was awkward, awful and slooooow. I contacted management via the info on my receipt and never head back. Well guess what, I'm not going back!
Nothing spectacular but not a disappointment. 1 worker during a 9pm rush. He was friendly and running around like crazy filling orders. \n\nNo seating to hang out besides 3 stools (I think). Fairly overpriced for being Hershey and perry's brand ice cream. Sundae was 2 small scoops, tiny bit of fudge, and crushed oreos for $4.50. \n\nCompared to Pages Dairy Mart or Antney's this place would be a 2 star, but if you're looking for something sweet and don't mind paying a little too much for what you get, it's not too bad. Out of convenience, I'm sure I'll be back. New to this side of the city but see no competition for me to go elsewhere.\n\nAs for their website; very confusing. Menu is all jumbled with all their locations mixed within. The sundae I wanted, wasn't even listed inside the Bloomfield location so I got something else. Could definitely organize and separate the locations menus.
Here it is my 100th review here on my favorite website. If any place is deserving of being my big milestone review it's Zenith.\n\nWhile I'd been there more than once before, it had been too long and I didn't think I could accurately review it without more recent research being done. (Which is a great excuse for me to go back and have brunch again and again and again. I am a research assistant extraordinaire.) Let's take two things I love thrifting/antiques and brunch and smash them all together into one Sunday morning good time. \n\nThe interior of this store/restaurant is so full of interesting bits that there are things literally hanging from the ceiling. When you walk into the main room it's almost a feeling of sensory overload. So many fun items to look at and touch. You can buy everything, right down to the chair you sit in while you eat and the dishes you use. It's not particularly a perfect place for preschoolers though as some pieces are precariously perched and practically praying to be pushed over. (Like that alliteration I used there? Priceless!) Just one hiccup, a lot of items have no prices on them and I'm not really sure where you take an item you want to purchase.\n\nIt's best to get there before they open at 11am as a line begins to form immediately. For $10 you get to pick an entree (of which they have 5 or 6 options which change each week), hot or cold tea or coffee, and access to the buffet. The options are vegan or vegetarian and they always have fresh fruit and fresh baked breads. The dessert table is usually various pies and bundt cakes. The flavors are great and subtle too.\n\nIt's a small space so if you're claustrophobic or don't like beat sat with strangers this most likely isn't for you. They do take cards or cash so you're safe either way. \n\nIf you're looking for a unique brunch experience you'll want to make the Southside a stop off.
I was visiting my friend from out of town with another vegan friend, and she took us here for Sunday brunch. It is hands down my favorite place and I wish they had one in NY/CT! We got there early to make sure we could get a seat since the line apparently gets long. The brunch included an entree PLUS the brunch. That was definitely more food than needed, I would have been happy with just the brunch, but wanted to try the entree as well. So I tried to take tiny portions of the brunch food just to get a taste.\n\nThe setting was super cute too! Very quirky and fun. The prices were a great deal too. I had to drive around a block for parking but found parking on the street. I hope to go back next time I'm in Pittsburgh!
Ok. I have now been to Zenith, NOT for shopping, but for their delicious food!\n\nThere evening dinners are a feast of cheap and plentiful vegan and vegetarian cuisine.\nAnd then there is the Sunday brunch...\nFor 10 bucks you get coffee, an all-you-can-eat buffet of every type of salad, noodles, cakes, and pies imaginable... PLUS a brunch entree!\nGet there early or you will have to wait.  The atmosphere is super casual, the food is homemade, and it is the perfect spot to catch-up with friends.
Delicious food aplenty for not a lot of penny in a setting that makes anybody smile.  Unique vegetarian menu in this antique shop venue -- with waitstaff with a friendly, can-do attitude.
The soup here is really good and isn't pounded with msg.\nThe wontons here are always a must !! \nCombine that with any of their noodle soups or peanut noodles and you'll be filled up. \nGood prices and pretty good quality food !!
I love this place, not a fan of their pancakes but the rest of the food is awesome, this is a treasure in Pittsburgh. I enjoy it much and please ignore the less than favorable reviews, this is just home style vegetarian & vegan food, not gourmet, I will say some of their  dishes I would say I consider gourmet, this good hearty food and reasonable...
One and a half stars only.  Some Yelpers rate this restaurant 4 and 5 stars?  Really??  Come on, it is not even close to a three.  4 and 5 stars are reserved for the finest tables in the best restaurants in the world.  Here, the food was poor to unremarkable.  I had lunch here with my girlfriend on 07/02/16.  Nothing was that good, except the service. She agreed!  The food was mediocre at best.  Most Thai places are generally acceptable and good.  Not Thai Spice.  This was an LV rated place, but we didn't find it worth a second trip.  I had their lunch special and didn't finish it.
Two of my favorite places in Madison are Pizza Brutta and Brasserie V. Grampa's Pizzeria is what would happen if my two favorite's had baby, who grew up to be a 20-something hipster who would obviously live on Willy Street and turn the farm-to-table up to 11. \n\nSo far so good. But as with many 20-somethings, a little age and wisdom will do wonders to take Grampa's from 4 stars to 5. There's really only one thing I would change - the crust is a little flat and boring and could use some complexity. A minor quibble, maybe, but you know - it is a pizza place...it's pretty important to nail crust. But perhaps that's a skill that you develop in your 30's.
absolutely the best pizza i've had in my face. ever.\n\ni do, however, want to take this opportunity to share with readers that this restaurant is not an extension of your living room; nor is it red robin or tgi friday's. this is a cozy little eatery with little room for double-wide strollers or your ego.\n\nit is a place to enjoy the best pizza you'll ever eat, pure and simple. there are no airs put about, nor are you owed anything; stop being pretentious.\n\nshow up hungry and leave more satisfied than you've ever been\n\nand give 'em a break, imagine the trials of running an independent restaurant and show some compassion.
I ordered take out from this restaurant and I had their chicken chop soy noodles which was delicious. I have been inspired by their flavours and consistency. The portion is huge and so filling for what you pay. The receptionist was so nice and made me wait. I got my order within 10 minutes and it was fresh. At the first bites, I loved the fact that it was healthy and not too oily. I'd recommend it to everyone as the food is good. Would return
How do you buy an established pizza restaurant and F it up so bad? I used to get the thin crust \"personal\" sized pizzas from Giovanni (wild guess) and went in last week with a craving for one.\nThe new owners seem nice enough, though what I received was a humongous pizza that seems as though it had been made by Pizza Pizza or some other generic joint. I was totally disappointed and will not likely return and definitely won't unless they get some green olives!
Believe it or not, I finally had my first Matt's experience this morning... I'd been hearing about Matt's Big Breakfast for ages, but never really wanted to make the drive to wait forever just for a greasy breakfast!\n\nHowever, we were talked into Matt's by some friends of ours that were also Matt's virgins... we met there around 10am, only to find that there were about 2 full pages worth of names ahead of us, and that they would not quote a wait... Matt's was smaller than I imagined, so I knew it would take awhile.  We debated going elsewhere and even went over to The Turf for coffee.  (If the service there were better there, we probably would've just stayed there, but we figured if we were going to wait, we'd just wait for Matt's).  My pregnant friend went into Matt's at one point to use the bathroom and they told her she had to go to the hotel nextdoor and 'ask for Mike.'  That was a bit shady...\n\nAbout an hour and a half later, our party of four was seated... and needless to say, we were all starving by then!  We started with some fresh squeezed OJ and coffee.  (The OJ glasses were tiny, but each sip tasted like heaven... and I was pleased to see that they use coffee fresh from Cave Creek Coffee Co.)\n\nWhen it was time to order, I was extremely disappointed that after that long wait, they were out of whole wheat toast.  I ended up getting an egg white omelette (yes, they do egg whites), hashbrowns, sour dough toast + preserves.  I could eat only about half of it... but what I did eat was good, greasy, and filled me up for most of the day.\n\nI don't really see myself rushing back to Matt's again anytime soon - unless it's on a weekday when the wait isn't so bad.  But I will say I'm happy that I finally made it to Matt's - and oh, what an experience it was!
Be warned of you have Celiac's do not eat here! We stayed at the Hard Rock for my sister's Bachelorette Party and ate at Fu Saturday night and had a horrible experience. \n\nWe specifically alerted the waiters that our bride has Celiac's and can not have gluten. They assured us the Pad Tai noodles are gluten free after eating some the bride started to feel sick. We asked the waiter if he was certain the dish was indeed gluten free, he said he would check. When he returned to our table he said \"no the dish is full of gluten... No just kidding\" this response was completely rude, insensitive and uncalled for. \n\nThis completely ruined the rest of our weekend as the bride was throwing up and in pain. We were unable to go to XS to see Zedd and use our prepaid passes. This experience was horrible and ruined half of our trip!
Michelle was a very offensive waitress. When she came to our table she offered soda and water and then proceeded to say \"idk, are you old enough to drink?\" when I asked about any drink specials/for a drink menu. I am 21 and definitely look old enough to drink so when she assumed my friends and I were underage we were all very offended and didn't like her judgmental tone. She was sloppy, unfriendly and brought checks without asking if we were finished or if we wanted another round of drinks. So rude and made my friends and I feel unwelcome. Would not return. As a waitress in a the past, I always tip 25%. I still tipped her okay in case it was a fluke but I was very unimpressed with the service.
I had the blessed chance to have some wine and pizza at my apartment on a Friday night after a terribly hectic week. Spinato's is a spot that is on my list of places to try in my 'hood. So I called my order in; a large Get Meaty with extra cheese. I went to the store to pick up a bottle of Peachy Canyon Zin, and grabbed my pizza on the way back home. HOLY COW, my pizza was huge! Oh well, I'll have leftovers. It seemed like it took forever to get home because the pizza's aroma wafted through my car and drove me crazy! I got home opened the box, and marveled at the sight of my yummy pizza. The pizza is not sliced into triangles, rather, they are sliced into squares. I grabbed a couple squares and noticed the GREASE that oozed through the cheese on the pizza. Uh oh. I grabbed a few paper towels and firmly patted my pizza. I thought to myself \"This is one greasy pizza! This is going to be awesome!\" I felt guilty and rebellious taking the first bite of my pizza. I was immediately struck by the sweetness of their sauce! It wasn't too terribly sweet, but I must say I like a slightly sweet red sauce. It may catch some people off guard. The meat on the pizza was delicious! The sausage was flavorful and I think it's home-made. I ended up sticking the leftovers in the freezer for future indulgence. We'll see if it's just as tasty later on.\n\nSpinato's offers pasta dishes which I'd like to try as well a garlic bread and antipasti. I look forward to visiting Spinato's again!
Had Spinato's for take out last night. Good service... Ordered the sausage thin crust. The bottom of the crust wasn't very good, could have been cooked longer. Sauce was a little sweeter and didn't have any special flavor. Pizza seemed like it had too much cheese. Not the pizza for me.
I visited Spork last night with a party of 4 of my friends. We enjoyed ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING! The experience was amazing, and I especially loved how the tapas plates are actually played as small portions of full meals, with lots of flavor and expertly executed preparation. \n\nThe menu changes daily, but we had white bean spread, green bean salad, mussels, and the duck. We also got a special send out from the kitchen of polenta cakes that were AMAZING. \n\nOverall, the ambiance is amazing and it's a super cozy restaurant. I didn't order a drink, but the cocktail menu and beer/wine list looked like it has great options! The pricing is amazing for the quality and value you receive at Spork. Oh... and be sure to actually use your Spork to eat your meal!
I really wanted to love this place!! I have tried Spork once & will never go back. The aesthetic inside has a rather cute rustic/hipster vibe. Our waitress was very attentive, however not very nice or approachable. In asking her to explain some of their wine selections she was extremely condescending & not very knowledgeable. I ordered the burger & the bun was so dry/old it was inedible. There were also ingredients that came on it that weren't listed on the menu including a sauce. I get the image this place is trying to portray, but if you're going to do it at least do it right. I can't speak for the other three people I ate with, however they had at least 6+ other menu items & didn't finish any of them either.
Everything won't be available on the menu and the service will be delightfully disorganized but the food will make you feel like your at your Korean Aunties house you didn't know you had. Sooo good, sooo authentic and they have pitchers of beer.
Did I just pay $8 for a bagel thin sandwich and an unsweetened iced tea?  Why yes, I did, and I'm going to enjoy it's toasty goodness in moderation.  \n\nThe service here is spot-on.  Super fast, friendly and the order is always made just the way you like it.  I enjoy the rosemary bagel (made into a \"thin\" where the center is cut out.  BTW: I wonder where the insides go...am I allowed to take it home?  I will ask next time.) with light veggie cream cheese, smoked salmon, extra red onion, extra tomato, no capers. The bagels are nice and crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Mmmm carb heaven. \n\nA BIG plus is the free Wi-Fi and the access to seating/outlets.
This is the closest Pita Jungle to my office. I love the food and often call ahead and just pick up because this parking lot is a damn nightmare during the lunch rush. If you are dining in though, things do move very quickly. I appreciate the staff at this location not being the usual apathetic hipster PJ is known for. The manager guy here, don't know his name, really knows what he is doing. My favorite to-go dish is the chicken shwarma wrap. It has PICKLES like all wraps with chicken should :)  I also love the glazed chicken pizza...omg caramelized onion-y goodness with chunky feta, how can you go wrong. And it's huge so you get two meals. Other faves: hummus with chicken, black bean burger, cilantro jalapeno hummus with pita chips, tzatziki, broiled chicken salad for when I want something really light.
I know it's busy and all but my double double had burnt things in my burger. Really gross In and Out. Typically all in and out is super clean. Apparently this one is the exception.
GOGI is a welcome addition to the (few) Korean food options in the Phoenix area.  The soon tofu soup is pretty good.  Would be nice if you were able to increase or decrease the spice level for varying tastes. I felt like something small was missing, though I can't quite put my finger on it (maybe more anchovy)?  Still tasty, however.  We also had the bulgogi and pork bulgogi, both of which were excellent.  Like other Yelpers have mentioned, the banchan (sides) were also great!\n\nThe service here is wonderful.  Very attentive and quick to refill your drinks and side dishes.\n\nPrice is reasonable.  As expected, the lunch prices are slightly lower than dinner.\n\nWould go back!
Loved GOGI. They should open a branch in Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Chandler is too far away for the Phoenicians. Went with my fiends and husband. We ordered the chicken bibimbap, pork belly, chicken yakisoba and chicken teriyaki. Other than the teriyaki, the rest were scrumptious. I will surely go there if I am Chandler again.
This burger place is located inside the Cosmopalitan hotel & casino on the second floor. Upon arrival we were seated in the dining area away from the bar...a seat near the tv was requested and was received since the place wasnt that busy. Ordered the rising sun burger which is a house favorite...and upon my first bite i figured out why- its f' delicious! Got it medium well with shoe string fries and couldnt be happier...argueable the best burger ive ever had. My brother ordered the california burger  with steak fries also medium well - he enjoyed the perfect amount of spice and the avocado was a great addition to all the flavor. When we checked in via foursquare we discovered a coupon for a complimentary house lager with any entree and after a quick chat with the manager on duty I was drinking free beer! My brother ordered a cup of coffee which the waitress did not add to the bill and thus we tipped handsomely ontop of the already attentive service. Overall a great burger place, a bit pricey but worth it in our opinion. The decorations and atmosphere of the place is really unique too!
I work in the area and I go here all the time.  Love the guac, never had a bad meal.  The staff is very very friendly.  I love that I can order on line, at my desk, exactly what I want.  They tell me what time it will be ready for pick. Quick, delicious and friendly.
The chips were pretty damn good and the food was made from good quality ingredients.  \n\nI just can't believe I paid $10 for a fricking burrito.  It wasn't even that big.  For $10, I want a burrito I can eat for 3 meals.\n\nThey do have a really huge selection of tequilas though.
Worried it wasn't a steakhouse but glad when we looked around. Lots of food, great value for good food. Chef was great but waitress was off point. Will recommend
While last night was somewhat disappointing, the Manager, Evan, made up for it all. He went above and beyond. We will be back thanks to Evan's positive attitude and hospitality.
Awesome is the only description suitable for this place. The drinks, the meats, and overall service is truly amazing! I definitely will return. 5 Stars!!!
I never write restaurant reviews but tonight I thought I had to write one. When Milestones first came to Toronto maybe about 15 years ago now, I thought the food was pretty good. \nToday I took my wife and son to the new one on Enterprise blvd. for lunch. I ordered the mushroom soup and the garden burger. My wife had a chicken and pasta dish. The food was mediocre. The waiter said they changed 90% of their menu. Our waiter's hospitality was on the same level as the food. He never bothered to come by and ask how the food was, which I become accustomed to in Canadian restaurants. Now, the reason why I'm really writing this review is that at around 9:30pm at night, more than 6 hours after my lunch, I'm still feeling very thirsty. I must've drunk more than 3 liters of water by now. I remembered from my last visit at Milestones, years ago, that I had the same thirsty feeling. This usually means to me that there's a lot of MSG in the food. I don't think I will go back anymore. Anyone having the same thirsty feeling after a visit to Milestones?
Ambiance and service is terrific. The food however is a different story. The parking is another tragedy of this location. \n\nI can't believe how atrocious the parking facilities are. Having getting over this by our 5+ minute stroll in the deep freeze, I was able to warm up in the restaurant. \n\nI had a particularly difficult time in selecting my meal. What I settled on was greeted with cheese on the noodles. Personally, I like certain cheeses, but I truly dislike grated cheese on my pasta. Why do restaurants automatically add cheese to their food? Unfortunately it came that way, but the server was kind enough to replace my destroyed entre\u00e8. Like it said, service was great!\n\nThe food overall is a just very average, while you're paying for the use of their nicely appointed facilities.
Here for brunch on a Valentine's Sunday to be surprised to see that it wasn't very busy. My boyfriend and I had the brunch special that came with eggs Benny, mimosa and fruit.\n\nMimosa came out in a wine glass because they ran out of clean champagne glasses. I didn't mind it until I realized how sticky our glasses were. My boyfriend had to wipe it down with some water and a napkin because he couldn't hold it.\n\nOur fruit came out relatively quick but soon realized that we were waiting a while for our entr\u00e9e. Looking around, it seemed like everyone else was also waiting........\n\nOverall, I thought the unclean glasses and long wait for food put a damper on the whole brunch.
After nearly 10 years without dining here, I was back and was not disappointed. It is still one of my favorite Japanese restaurants, perhaps my favorite in Madison. Great selection of veggie rolls.
I went once with a friend and have gone back ever since!! I am regular here. I love their soba and udon! Their appatizers aren't worth the money but their entr\u00e9es are perfect! Helpful staff.
Extensive menu best calzone I've had!! My hubby and I loved it! The gals are nice too!!
I've been to scores of Vietnamese restaurants and while the decor is a notch above and it's convenient and easy to park, this one excels for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. Unfailing great service: Kim is attentive, genuine and always helpful with suggestions, as are the many other family members we gave met over our repeated visits.  You can eat family style at many places but few make you feel like family.\n\n2. The food.  I love pho as well as many if the vermicelli and egg noodle dishes and am never disappointed.  The broth for the pho is richer, more flavorful, and more fragrant than many other places (and asian cuisine abounds in Chandler).  They have the usual great appetizers including perfect spring rolls but what you CANNOT miss is the outstanding mango sorbet served as dessert!  Never too sweet but packed with flavor; always light and refreshing.\n\nI'll be going back again (and soon) fir another great meal and friendly service!
The food and service here are great! The restaurant is right across the street from the Lee Lee Supermarket shopping center. The food here is definitely better than other Viet places I've tried in Chandler so far.\n\nHere's what I've ordered:\nChao Ga (Chicken Porridge) - Really good! I was sick and it totally hit the spot!\n\nThit Nuong Cuon (grilled pork summer roll) - Good, but I wish I would've ordered the Fresh Summer Roll instead. I prefer the peanut sauce over the fish sauce with my rolls!\n\nBun Chao Tom (ground shrimp and noodles with veggies) - Really good!\n\nDefinitely a must try! You won't be disappointed.
If I could give it a zero rating, then I would! Today was my first time shopping here, and it is definitely my last time.\n\nAttracted by some butternut squashes on sale, I thought I was going to get a bargain. But, it turns out that I fell for a trap! I handed $12 in 2 fivers and two loonies to the cashier to cover my bill of $6.76, but she only gave me a quarter back. Despite my objection on the spot she insisted that I only handed her $7. She wouldn't even check to see if indeed she took two five dollar bills in by accident.\n\nAnother customer commented that this frequently happens at the Lucky Moose Food Mart, and that she had been double-charged before, and the cashier refused to return her money. So all shoppers beware! Some times it's not worth sacrificing customer service for price!
My husband and I sat at the bar and were amazed at the care that was taken with each cocktail. It was truly mesmerizing. The mixologists were very intent on making each drink to perfection. We didn't order food, but the customer next to us ordered a hamburger that looked amazing. We thought the atmosphere was perfect. Dark and romantic and not too noisy at all. We will visit again next time we are in Charlotte!
same story as the ones in cali.\nlong line , but this one took seriously about 1/2 to get thru the drive thru.
I finally made it over to My Florist for lunch.  I had the turkey and brie sandwich.  It was excellent.  The service was great.  I liked the space.  I will definitely go back.
Not terribly impressed.  Yes, it is inexpensive, but it does not have all that many other merits.  The food is a sort of passable imitation of  Vietnamese and some other Asian cuisines.  The pho they rave about so much had kind of a weird tasting broth and other dishes were just so-so.  Get out of downtown and go to an ethnic Vietnamese conclave instead for better Vietnamense food.  Service was okay.   Atmosphere is nothing special either.
Hemingways is such a good stand by. It's great right after work to be able to grab a beer and not be bothered. They have decent food and always good specials. This is not a date night or take your parents but is always a good place to chill
Great taco shop! Get the carna asada tacos. Squeeze some limes on them and add some salt to top it off. Perfection!\n\nOne of the best taquerias ever. All our coworkers can always agree on this place. Price is very reasonable so we always come here for lunch.
Service was slow and had an attitude from the start. Mixed cocktails were bad. I've had plenty of mixed drinks in my lifetime and these were horrible. We had to return the drinks twice and then got attitude from management stating that the drinks were made correctly and it was us who were wrong. We had the specials and the food was good. Steak was tender and had good flavor. We ordered the baked brie before we finished our meal and it never arrived. We finally gave up and got more attitude when we asked for the check so we could leave. They didn't tell us the Brie took about 20 minutes to cook when we ordered it, however, it was over 20 minutes and it was no where to be found. Very frustrated with the poor service.
This place is awesome! There is a wonderful selection of beers around the world and a decent selection of spirits for those that are interested. The food is delicious, but the selection of food is mostly just standard American stuff.  The service is always splendid! In the summer there is a really nice patio to sit at :)
The mussels due hour is their most distinctive and delicious menu item, but there are many great alternatives at fair prices. Both the bar and the restaurant tables are very popular in this great Capitol Square location. Hardwood floors and a plaster ceiling makes for a loud environment.
Continue to shine and always busy!   First, I can't say enough about the service; excellent personalization.  Food was consistent and to a high standard as usual.  The highlight was actually the kids menu!   My kids are used to go home cooking and their mac n cheese is stellar!  Not to mention, comes with fresh fruit, veggies and even a beverage!  Also, the mac n cheese is top notch; creamy, tangy and chewy!
Great food and service - will make sure to eat here at each trip to Vegas. We had a party of 15 and the staff was able to accommodate us without any issues
Allgemein\nDas \"La Fuente\" hat vor einigen Monaten in Echterdingen er?ffnet und wirbt auf seiner Webseite mit spanischen Spezialit?ten und hausgemachten Tapas. Das Restaurant ?ffnet mittags um 11.30 Uhr, wir waren um 12.00 Uhr da. Beim ?ffnen der Eingangst\u00fcr erschreckte uns zuerst die sehr laute Musik, die sp?ter auf normale Hintergrundmusik reduziert wurde. Es gibt zwei Gastr?ume, einen rechts und und einen links vom Eingang. Auf der rechten Seite befindet sich die Theke, daher gingen wir nach links, weil wir es gerne etwas ruhiger haben. Eine der beiden Damen, die im Restaurant arbeiten, bemerkte kurz: \"Sie m\u00fcssen auf die andere Seite gehen, ich bin noch nicht fertig mit Putzen!\" Also gingen wir auf die andere Seite und suchten einen Tisch aus, an dem es Platz zum Sitzen gab, da das Personal seine Habseligkeiten \u00fcberall verteilt hatte: eine ge?ffnete Handtasche stand auf einem Stuhl, \u00fcber anderen Stuhllehnen hingen Jacken. Offenbar hatte man 1/2 Std. nach der ?ffnung noch nicht mit G?sten gerechnet.\nBedienung\nMan brachte uns die Karte, und wir bestellten die Getr?nke und verschiedene Tapas. Dann warteten wir, und warteten..... Statt uns schon mal die Getr?nke zu bringen, schrieb die Bedienung erst noch einmal unsere Bestellung ins Reine. Endlich kamen die Getr?nke und nach ca. 10 Minuten die ersten 2 Tapas. Das Glas meines Mannes war zwischenzeitlich leer und stand neben dem Teller, aber man kam nicht auf die Idee zu fragen, ob er noch etwas trinken wolle. Wieder warteten wir... Dann kamen wieder 2 Tapas und nach einiger Zeit dann der Rest. Wobei das Brot mit dem Allioli ganz zum Schlu? gebracht wurde. Eigentlich i?t man das als erstes!\nNachdem wir die Rechnung bestellt hatten, kam die Bedienung und brachte einen Zettel, auf dem handschriftlich einige Zahlen untereinandergeschrieben und addiert worden waren. Auf meine Frage, ob wir auch einen Beleg mit den einzelnen Posten bekommen k?nnten, erwiderte sie: Ja, aber das dauert einen Moment, das macht meine Kollegin. Das dauerte dann fast 10 Minuten! Die Kollegin mu?te erst jeden einzelnen Posten in die Kasse eingeben, zum Schlu? war es falsch und sie fing wieder von vorne an.\n\nUnser Fazit: Alles wirkte auf uns sehr unprofessionell und so, als ob man vorher noch nicht im Gastronomiebereich gearbeitet h?tte. Wir k?nnen das \"La Fuente\" leider nicht weiter empfehlen und werden sicher auch nicht mehr hingehen. Wer gute Tapas essen m?chte, sollte sich ein anderes Lokal suchen.\nDas Essen\nWir hatten 6 verschiedene Tapas bestellt: Pimiento atun mit Thunfischf\u00fcllung, Pimiento mit Hackfleischf\u00fcllung, Tortilla de Patatas, Albondigas (Hackfleischkl??chen), Knoblauchbrot und Champignons mit Knoblauch. Die Portionen sind klein und den Preisen keinesfalls angemessen. Die Champignons waren nicht frisch sondern aus der Dose oder aus dem Glas, kleingeschnitten und mit Kr?utern. Von Knoblauch keine Spur. Insgesamt ca. eine Hand voll f\u00fcr 4,50 Euro. Die Hackfleischkl??chen waren auch nicht frisch, sondern ein Fertigprodukt. Sie sahen aus wie gepre?tes Hackfleisch, bei frischem Hackfleisch ist die Konsistenz grober. Geschmacklich auch eher fade. Die Tortilla war m.E. auch ein Fertigprodukt. Die Form war zu glatt und gleichm??ig, so sieht keine selbstgemachte Tortilla aus. Die gef\u00fcllten Paprika schmeckten ebenso wenig hausgemacht, so was kann man in gro?en Mengen im Gro?handel kaufen. Keines der Gerichte hat wirklich gut geschmeckt, alles war Durchschnitt. Wir haben \u00fcber 6 Jahre in Spanien gelebt und oft Tapas gegessen, daher waren wir sehr entt?uscht.\nDas Ambiente\nDie Einrichtung ist einfach und n\u00fcchtern, nichts erinnert daran, dass man sich in einem spanischen Restaurant befindet.\nSauberkeit\nDas Restaurant machte einen sauberen Eindruck.
This is my go to place for Vietnamese food. Best pho I've ever had. The food comes out really fast and the service is good. The servers first language isn't English so just be patient with them, they are super friendly and attentive to their customers.
Had potstickers and pho tonight and was VERY PLEASED!  It was my 1st time here & I'm going to be a regular customer. \nThe portion size of the potstickers was perfect for my niece & I to share.  The dipping sauce was a light ginger soy & just right. Not salty or bitter or too sweet. \nWe had Pho Tau with beef balls and rare beef slices. The broth was rich, lightly seasoned & NOT greasy! Beef balls & slices were tasty as were the rice noodles.  I seasoned with just lime and loved it. \nPortion size is huge & I'll have lunch tomorrow too! \nPrices are reasonable. My niece, the pho snob, loved it. It wasn't busy because we came in about 830 pm but service was timely and friendly. Hopefully our review entices others to try this place.
we were here last month, trying to get our fix for pho; but was left disappointed.  First off, the place was pretty empty so the workers seemed to be relaxed, they were yapping away loudly...an employee turned on some kid's program in an effort to entertain his young niece (tv is mounted high atop a wall which was visible to customers).   No music or any other noise except the continuing of the workers (possibly owners)  conversations.  it just seemed to be more of a converted eating place than a restaurant...setup the tv elsewhere if you want to babysit your kids, have your private conversations quietly behind the counter...just a thought...\nwe would skip this pho place!
I love the baked pork chop tomato rice.  It comes in a massive portion.  I tried chicken on rice with garlic sauce today.  It's my new favorite. The french toast was perfect only i couldn't finish it.  It's a meal in it self.  Great milk tea but i usually get it with less milk.
This place really stinks. The service was awful. The frumpy waitron seemed pained by us being there and rarely even looked in  our direction. We sat with empty glasses for at least ten minutes. Had to go the bar to get our cocktails. The bartender was fast, but then he put the drinks on the table tab and winked at the waitron. WTF? Needless to say, no one got the tip. I saw many tables gazing longingly at the server who could obviously care less about being there. \n\nAnd the food? Straight out of a can. The bar just seemed kinda dirty... like a barn or something. The locals warned us! We really should have stayed away. The name of the joint was a red flag as well. Lesson learned.
I was looking for a sports bar to watch NFL games and could not find any decent ones along the strip. Then i came upon TAP. A good place to watch the game. The atmosphere was great for a sports fan. A big down side is that they do not serve their menu until after 11:00am, before that they only have 2 items to choose from. A little pricey but what do you expect from a sports bar on the strip.
As many other reviewers have mentioned, they're cheap and they're timely with the deliveries. The food's really standard Americanized Chinese fare and it tastes pretty decent -- It's pretty much a not-so-greasy/non-greasy alternative to Asian Kitchen and I personally find them a bit better tasting than Asian Kitchen in general.
You can't beat this.\nAll day special:\none pork egg roll or order of crab rangoon\none entree (choose from 30 or so dishes)\nsteamed or fried rice\ncan of soda\nuntil 4pm, $5.19\nafter 4pm, $5.79\nif you want it \"large\", $6.79\nI had hunan chicken which featured large pieces of white meat chicken, no gristle, lots of seemingly fresh veggies (broccoli, peppers, onion, etc.), and a nicely spiced and not too sweet sauce. The fried rice was yellow and nothing spectacular. It's a great deal for takeout. The small filled me up (and I have a big appetite for Chinese takeout!)\nI haven't experienced any customer service problems, but while I was there waiting for my food, there were two other guys waiting. One had ordered a small special with general tso's and one had ordered a large general tso's. They called out \"one kung pao chicken\" and it seemed like it could have turned into a big debacle, but the guys who wanted general tso's corrected them and the guys behind the counter promptly brought them their correct orders. \nI did appreciate the health department's \"symptoms of norovirus\" flier posted on the soda refrigerator...
Absolutely no and never again. First of all, $9.98 for chicken lomein that's half oil and half soy sauce? I could barely pick up the noodles with my chopsticks because they were covered in oil. No thanks.\n\nBut the main reason this place gets one star (and less if I had the option) is that there is no soap in the bathroom. I went to wash my hands before I ate, and I noticed that there was no more soap; therefore, I did the courteous thing and asked the female cook that there was none, and she told me that they had no more! What restaurant doesn't carry a backup of soap?! I'm assuming the men's room didn't have any either, which means that every time the cooks used the bathroom, they didn't clean their hands! I gagged. Any restaurant that doesn't even stock the most basic way of cleaning your hands is disgusting.\n\nDirty hands, oily noodles, and inflated prices for unsanitary and just flat out bad food. No thanks.
Stopped in for lunch today. First impression is it is very nice, clean pizzaria. The staff is very kind and friendly. I ordered the italian beef sandwich, it was loaded with perfectly cooked beef on fresh made seeded roll with a healthy portion of giardiniera. I also ordered a slice of the eat your spinach pie. The toppings were fresh and delicious. The crust was cooked perfectly. You can tell everything is made fresh daily and they really care about their product. What a wonderful experience I will definitely be back.
Excellent Prickly Pear Margarita, with a Roasted Elephant Garlic appitizer! I love the (melt in your mouth)10oz. Santa Fe Filet Mignon with the choice of a comforting Green Chile MAC & Cheese or a piped Red Chile Mashed Potato in a halved Green Hatch Chile & Vegetables....Yum!
I wish I could rate it higher because the girl was very nice to help me however the selection was lacking today and the wait was super long. There were zero brownie bites available and only one box of carrot bites. And two ready made boxes of cookies and only one plain bagel...I'm on the run most days and need quick fresh treats available and typically can get my needs met here.
Went there with a couple of friends for happy hour.   I can't find their menu on the 'net so I'll have to describe what I had versus the actual name.   We had the dilly beans, which we agreed was interesting but we barely ate it.   Since none of us is from the south, maybe it's not something we're used to.   String beans which tasted a lot of dill and deep fried was most interesting but to us not palatable.  We had the smoked chicken wings, which we agreed was quite smoky, but otherwise was not too tasty.  Left some of that on the serving platter as well.   Quite frankly, it could be it is not our collective tastes in food, but I know I, for one in our group, would not return.   The server was very efficient and friendly, and we liked her.   Very friendly bartender and helpful as well.
This place is DISGUSTING!!! The dining room has ZERO clean tables, trash on the ground, ketchup all over the counter, chairs moved in places they shouldn't be, trash overflowing! GROSS! \n\nThis entire restaurant needs to be replaced! The employees walk around like they are zombies, they aren't friendly! Except the girl that took our order, she was the best part of the entire visit! The food was cold, the fries were half cooked and over leaded with salt! I should have left before we even ordered. \n\nWorse service ever when needing a refill! We are done here! NEVER COMING BACK! Read your reviews and fix your place before the health district comes and shuts you down!! Yuck!
I'm rounding up like another reviewer, in hopes that they might refine a few things. Stopped by with two co-workers for drinks and apps. Nice menu, and different cocktails. I like champagne and it's not often offered in bars, unless it is a $4 glass of J Roget or similar.\n\nThe space is large but furnished oddly - like a lounge/club - perhaps there is dancing on the weekends and the furniture is moved to the sides? I'm not sure. We were there after work, around 6 PM, so it didn't quite feel right.\n\nThe bar area is nice, if a tad over done. All the lights are gently pulsing LED's - a little would go along way. The bar light, the logo, the chandeliers - all slowly pulsing up and down. It's a little much.\n\nAppetizers were quite good and the bartender was very knowledgable about the preparation. The seviche (brought over from a sister restaurant) were great; savory crepe was larger than anticipated, and while not easy to share very good. They did not have an eggplant ratatouille ready yet (something about 3 hrs to prepare - come on guys, plan ahead) but offered a substitute that we were pleased with. Chef cam out to chat and was a very personable young man, enthusiastic and funny.\n\nI'll go back, but I would suggest they add maybe a banquette along the long wall with tables and chairs to accommodate dining - I think the food of high quality and they could really capitalize on it if the kitchen is large enough.\n\nI didn't know about the dress code, but we came from work and passed the requirements.
Damn, this place won't die! Did up here in Seattle but lives on down there. I guess we have too many umbrellas to want more in our drinks. The menu here is always a variation of the past, but not badly upgraded over the years. Like Queeque.....uh Starbucks, McDonalds, etc this place is a known quantity even if not overly exciting, and drinking here is as comfortable as an old pair Wellingtons from the sheep ranch. Baaaahhhhhhhh!
After spending nearly an hour after being buzzed from the \"High Octane\" drink from Fat Tuesdays at the roulette machine in the Planet Hollywood, I heard my tummy grumble.  \n\nWe didn't really know where to eat and we walked by Trader Vic's on the way out of the casino.  I'm a fan of Asian Fusion food and even though there is one here in the bay area, I've never felt compelled to try it so I said why not?  \n\nWe sat in the terrace and it was not too hot since they had the mist fans on full blast.  Service was good too but food was not good.  We ordered a seared tuna appetizer and lobster pot stickers.  Tuna was bland and the salad that came with it was too salty.  The pot stickers were tasty but the salad that accompanied it made it salty too.  \n\nWe ordered a steak sandwich medium.  It was over cooked and nothing special.  I also ordered the Tom Yum Gai soup and it was gross.  It was so bitter.  They needed to toned down the ginger and lemongrass I think.  \n\nThey get 2 stars for service and location with a nice view of the Bellagio and the Paris hotels but that's about all going for them.
Breakfast here is always good, that's why there's a wait on weekends. I've enjoyed a couple of different omelets and Ada G. always gets the pig and cow omelet (or something like that, I never remember the name). It's her favorite. I'm a little ticked off still, and it's been about five hours since we left the restaurant, because I feel like we were nickel and dimed and that's one of the things I hate most. Like when you ask you a little extra sour cream and they charge you $2.50 (and you're eating a $5.00 burrito). They didn't do that, but we ordered milk for our kids, she has a four year old and I have the toddler of course. No, I take it back. The waiter specifically asked if we wanted anything to drink for the kids so we ordered some milk for them. The milk he brought came in styrofoam cups with lids. Pretty common if a restaurant doesn't have kids cups and they usually only have one size of styrofoam cups so they bring your drink in those. The kids of course each drank about a third of their gargantuan cups of milk and had enough. When the bill came (and unfortunately after we paid) I noticed that the waiter charged us for large milks. These aren't two lumber jacks. The toddler even still sits in a high chair. Why would either of them need 24 ounces of milk? Deep breathe. Let it go. It just seemed kind of jerky.\n\nThe food is good, all the omelets at least, I haven't got past them. If you go on a Saturday morning, beware of a little wait. It is a popular place. If you're not up for a huge meal, the portions are large enough to split. Ada G. and I probably would have but I wasn't in the mood for her snout and hoof omelet. Maybe next time. By the way, the Spanish omelet is great!
We showed up with a party of six and were given a condescending scolding by the host for not calling ahead (it was a Tuesday). We were annoyed to the point of leaving, but then, miraculously, they were able to accommodate us, despite our brazen stupidity. \n\nI will say that the food was decent, though, and the server was friendly enough. \n\nTotally unrelated to anything: the 1989-style pleated khaki shorts that the poor staff are made to wear have got to go!  Time to modernize a little bit.
My favorite place to go in Arizona for breakfast wish they would open one out here in California
Pretty cheap Greek food but decent. The gyros seemed fresh and were decent. The dressing they use on the sandwiches and salads is delicious!
I don't know why I was so crabby back in 2012. Stopped in tonight and had the awesome strawberry salad and spaghetti with blush sauce and both blew me away...again.
My favourite place for xiao long bao (dumplings)!  They have a pretty good promotion, where the first bamboo steamer ranges from $1.99 to $3.99, and the second steamer would range from $2.99-$5.99.  \n\nWe were a group of four who went after 1 pm on a weekday, and were immediately seated.  After about 10 minutes, there was a long wait. The menu is great for me, because it has a photograph of each plate. We ordered one of each of the steamed dumplings, savory stick rice roll, the Chinese beef burger, the stir-fried rice cake with pork and veggie, pork jelly cake, fried egg white with broccoli, and shredded chicken in peanut sauce.  For a group of four this is way too much food, but a great variety.  I found the rice roll really bland and tasteless. The only thing I could taste was the shredded salted pork (the stuff you sometimes put on your congee).  As for the xiao long bao, it tasted great and soupy inside.  Service was fast and efficient.
Let me first start off by saying this is not my first time here. In fact, it's my 3rd time here. Their menu system is confusing to put into words but essentially it involves one regular menu in the black folder (good for when you go as a group), and they also have separate smaller menus (good for going alone or with a friend). The smaller menus are also significantly cheaper. However, there are definitely not as many options and it's mostly simple well-known dishes that everybody knows. \n\nI am only going to base this review off of what I had there today. I ordered the sweet and sour pork with rice for my main and then I also got fried dumplings (they were huge!). The rice dish was alright, it was average. The pork unfortunately was not as tender as I would've liked. But the veggies and pineapple and the red neon sauce (sweet and sour sauce) that gets mixed in with everything was fine. To be honest, I've never had an jaw-dropping sweet and sour pork dish before. I'm not sure how someone can go about making that dish amazing. You can definitely start off by choosing good cuts of meat, cooking it well, and making sure the protein is tender (also good veggies as well!). \n\nThe item on the menu that I order from almost any Chinese restaurant I go to is their fried dumplings or \"guo tier\" for those who know what I'm talking about. Essentially it's just an enlarged version of a dumpling that's pan fried. This place has very good guo tier consistently! Their stuffing first of all is very well seasoned, well balanced between veggies and meat, and the wrapping is done very well and it's cooked very well as well. Some places either have very good wrapping and poor stuffing or very good stuffing and poor wrapping. But this place has it all! That guo tier alone made this review get an extra star. \n\nThe waiting staff here is very friendly, decor is nice, location is nice. I eat out alone most of the time because I personally just like that. But this place is more than welcome to groups, individuals, parties, etc. \n\nGive this place a try!
This Friday night at the MGM Grand was extremely busy... Probably due to the Barbara Streisand concert in house which was amazing! Decided to start at Nobhill for a pre-show dinner after hearing marvelous things. \n\nWalked up the host stand which was surrounded by a sea of people, but thought ahead and made a reservation a month in advance (thank goodness we did!!) were greeted and shown to our table. \n\nGreeted by our server, who was excellent. Wish I would have gotten his name but none the less did a great job. Very efficient without being overbearing. \n\nStarted off with the Nobhill Cablecar, a must try drink!! The brown sugar rim was a very delicious touch.\n\nHad the lobster pot pie, once again amazing! The table side presentation definitely added a personal touch. Everyone should try this dish at least once while in Las Vegas. \n\nFor dessert, I had the beignets baked to perfection. \n\nAll around a good experience from beginning to end. \n\nWill definitely be back for more!!!
This place was heavenly. We leaned toward the seafood at this restaurant. Everything we ate had clean flavor and masterfully prepared (no overcooked or undercooked fish or scallops here). The menu wasn't anything too crazy, but more \"classic\" flavor, fresh ingredient sort of mix. This place just reminds me over and over again, that you don't need overly fancy decoration, or exotic mixture of ingredients, or some fancy technique involving liquid nitrogen. You just need fresh ingredients and hands that know how to bring out the natural flavors.
On our first night in Vegas, my friend and I were hoping to have a nice dinner at a place with interesting food.  \n\nWhat we got was a top-flight dining experience at a pretty good price, thanks to the Summer Menu that the restaurant was offering.  Many restaurants will offer sub-par selections for something like this, but not Nob Hill.  We got a generous sampling of appetizers to start, which went well with our cocktails.  This was followed (for me) by a spicy pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon, mashed turnips, and a slice of pure heaven, known to some as pork belly.   It was crispy and buttery in all the right places, and was a delightful surprise when it was brought to the table.   Also a delight was the quintet of mashed potatoes brought to us from the kitchen - flavored with things like hearts of palm, horseradish, and other amazing flavors.   We also received an amuse bouche at the beginning AND the end of the meal, after dessert.   \n\nIt's not the cheapest place on the strip, but if you're looking for a delicious splurge, I can't recommend it enough, especially if you're staying at the MGM or nearby.
Came here for a few special occasions and to see if the food lived up to the Iron Chef hype.\n\nFood [A] The overall quality of the food is quite good. Their signature dish, a massive pork chop is juicy and well seasoned. The only downside for the dish is the Midwest's current obsession with creamy (too easy to have runny) as opposed to grilled/seared polenta (personal pref for texture). The true standout here is the 6 AM special. It's a dessert that captures the perfect combination of sweet and savory with maple bacon ice cream, caramelized apple, served on french toast. I'm not big on desserts, but I came back to this restaurant within a couple days just to order it again. It's that good. The beef cheek pierogi was a tad on the salty side, but well balanced by the mushrooms. Another of my favorites was a duck breast dish that they no longer serve. It went through several iterations, including an Asian-ified (mediocre) as and a more classic French interpretation (much better). Ultimately, you are paying extra for the experience of eating at a celebrity chef's flagship restaurant.\n\nService [B+] For the prices and reputation of the restaurant, you would expect to be waited on hand and foot (or at least not have to make simple requests numerous times). Waitstaff here are less than attentive on multiple occasions, and their tone/attitude decidedly adds to the observation of the sub-optimal atmosphere as noted below.\n\nAmbiance [B+] The feel is definitely classy, but almost in the wrong way. It's like an inexplicably oppressive snootiness, with a \"dress up or die\" vibe. Some of the waitstaff here can give off a sense of entitlement, while giving some leeway considering that this is a top-rated restaurant in Cleveland, however, having such airs is also somewhat antithetical with the service industry and puts a damper on the dining experience. Seats are comfortable and lighting is ideal. Spacing between tables is also well positioned.\n\nAll in all, you can't go wrong with Lola as long as your wallet doesn't need to be resuscitated by the end of dinner. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would just to ding them for the service and ambiance, but I still think it's awesome that Symon has done a lot with the restaurant scene of his hometown so I'll round up instead of down.
Fantastic food. Reservations strongly recommended. Every bite is an experience. Pricey, but if exquisite flavor is what you desire, this is the place.
Went here on a Saturday around 1 which was the perfect timing because there wasn't a wait. Their menu is pretty big and their pancakes are the best. You can order a meal\nfor two and only spend $25. Their bacon is my favorite because it's always thick although a few pieces were burnt but everything else was good!
Finally I am writing a review after many years of making this my 'go to' for brunch on Sunday mornings. Service has improved lately also. Food always superb. Delicious salads on the side. When I ask for 'soft' omelette, that is what I get. Cafe au lait in bowls - a must. Sometimes we have to wait in line, but still worth it. And in summer sitting outside is a plus (and quieter). Cash only may be awkward but it's better than higher prices! Vive la Bonjour Brioche!
J'aime ca. \n\nCame here for the first time today. I have been meaning to try this place for a long time but was sort of turned off by the stories of its infamous long lines on weekends. My DC and I arrived a bit after 10AM and we just had one group ahead of us, and waited 5 minutes. Not bad at all. Although, during our brunch we watched as the line grew longer and longer (by the time we left, it was almost curling around the block). \n\nThe service is prompt. I think everyone is aware of the line, so the wait staff are very quick at taking orders and clearing dishes immediately. When we sat down, we were asked right away whether we'd like some coffee and croissants to start. I just had a tall glass of freshly squeezed OJ. \n\nI ended up deciding on the quiche de jour, which had spinach and feta. They also have a lorraine available every day. The quiche came in a generous portion. The crust was buttery and flaky and the filling with delicious (the eggs were fluffy and light, not too dense). It came with a pretty standard side of mixed greens with a basil-y vinaigrette dressing, and their lovely baguette served warm with butter. The DC had the Croque Madame, which looked like the perfect hearty hangover brunch. \n\nMid-way through our brunch, the owner very apologetically asked if we could move tables to accommodate a large group. It was no problem (we just had to slide over one table), and she gave us each a croissant of our choice for free as a 'thank you'. I opted for the chocolate croissant, which I enjoyed later this afternoon. It was just perfect -- soft, flaky, fresh, without too much filling. \n\nOther notes: \n- Tables are very close together and some groups of 3 were sharing just a tiny table meant for 2. \n- The side patio looks nice. \n- Cappuccinos come in those huge bowls. \n- Clock on the wall is 7 minutes fast. \n- According to my DC, this place is a \"gay hipster mecca\". I dunno. The crowd seemed pretty mixed to me. \n- Bill Cosby ate here apparently; his autograph is on the wall. \n\nAll in all, a nice brunch spot but I don't think I would line up more than 15-20 mins. for this place. The food is great, but there are also lots of other similar places that are less hyped with no lines.
The shawarma here is sooo good. It's their sauce that they r using . It's just yummmm.\n\nThe reason I am giving it 2 stars is because if the service .\nFor some reason it feels like the servers give me n my friends attitude. It doesn't look like they r happy to serve us . So the customer service is bad. They never smile to me when serving it's like a straight face with an angry look. Anyone else get that ? \n\nAlso I hav found a fly in my shawarma a once ...so I am on the look for a new shawarma place to give business too.\n\nBut no lies so far this is the best shawarma iv tasted...sucks the service is bad
We had a group of 14 and the service and food were amazing.  It's hard to find both with a party that large, but Wally's scored the highest markets.\n\nNot one person in our party did not love the food - from the burgers and mac and cheese to the pot roast and fish and chips everyone gave Wally's a 5 star review.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and had our table waiting upon arrival.  The waters were already set on the table and the drink orders came out quickly and correct.  The food for the group was out within 15 minutes of ordering and again it was all so tasty.  \n\nIts great \"pub\" food and we will be back!
Met my friend and his son at 4:30 . There were not many people there. Ordered happy hour food , Visited since we had not seen each other in 32 years. We has a lot catching up to do. Into the evening,  after ordering a burger, calamari, quesadillas , etcetera  we were told we needed to leave. When asked why they claimed you grabbed your breast and you all are intoxicated and we have reservations for your table..... I am still grabbing my breast at their behavior
Ate here yesterday for lunch. I had the spicy beef ramen and my friend had pad thai. Although I would have expected it to be a bit spicier, the soup was delicious. And the food was very reasonably priced. Definitely will come back.
This place is cheap but you get a lot for what you pay for. The service is very friendly and they have worthy weekly specials. I've never waited longer than 5 minutes for my order to-go.
I can not speak highly enough of this place. Everything is perfect. The sandwiches are fresh and delicious. The pastries are always warm crispy. Even the staff is willing to go out of there way to help accommodate any order. I frequent this bakery at least once a week and can not say how much I enjoy it every time.
I found the cutest and nicest cafe! I came out here for doctors appointment and stopped in It is so nice ! Pastry was homemade, fresh and delish! The person who waited on me ( might have been the owner) was so helpful and pleasant, couldn't have been any nicer! What a wonderful cafe Next time I'm going to have lunch because it looked fantastic !
We were just driving by thought we would stop and try this place No mistake it was very good. I tried the chicken vindaloo it was the best I every had, the price was good to. I will be back for sure
Great little discovery near by!! Sundays are typically my pizza day but felt like mixing it up today. \n\nIf you want delivery, your order needs to be placed with UberEats but take out was ready in less than 20 minutes. \n\nWe ordered the butter chicken on rice and the chicken curry rotti. People aren't joking! This is a massive amount of food!!!\n\nBoth were really tasted. Both meals were ordered with a medium spice level. The rotti was mild but that butter chicken - mmmmmmmm!!! But, I don't think I could progress to that next level of spice! Haha\n\nSmall number of tables inside - definitely more ideal for take out!
The woman giving me a to go order scratched her nose and ass crack in shorts as I was getting my food. Been to third world countries and never seen that.
Weekdays are usually a good time to go. Weekends are busy and long lines are not cool. Nice atmosphere plenty of clean tables and plenty of food to choose from.\nThis is restaurant is a good place to eat especially during the weekdays. Weekends is a different issue altogether.
Absolutely wonderful place. The food is great and the employees are kind. I go here with family, friends, and even by myself when I need the time alone but also want to eat tasty food. Thank you Sweet Tomatoes!
We LOVE going here on Monday because they have the best cream of mushroom soup ever. Great chicken noodle too. Been coming here for years and we keep coming back!
If you're trying to go healthy for the day or you just are heathly, this place is a treat !!
My wife and I have been to and loved The Dogs and Sea Dogs and were very keen to try this Italian version. Such is the popularity of these places that we had to wait for about 15 minutes for a table but it was definitely worth the wait. We ordered a chicken, bacon and chilli pizza, linguine with chicken and pesto and some bread with oil and vinegar for dipping. The food was simple and delicious and I would be happy to have paid more than the cheap price for it so like the other dogs restaurants this place is great value.
A true gem in the desert.  Do not judge this book by its cover.  Located in a older strip mall and sparsely decorated inside, Mucha Lucha is cranking out deeply flavorful delights.  Start with an order of 5 street tacos and mix 'em up to get a great sampling of the offerings.  My personal favorite is the carne asada but close seconds are the chicken and barbacoa.  Try them with the chipotle mayo in place of sour cream.\n\nOn your second visit, come for the breakfast burritos.  The El Jeffe is phenomenal with egg, chorizo, smiley bacon, carne asada and eggs.  I got mine as a chimichanga (fried burrito) smothered in green sauce.  This could be a world beater if they fried the burrito harder.  Ask for it crispy if that is what you want.\n\nIf this restaurant was near D.C. Ranch, there would be lines out the door every day for lunch and reviews monthly in Phoenix magazine comparing others to this new standard for flavors.
Awesome authentic Swabian-German food, beer and wine! \nMy husband and I came here for a date and we loved it! The waiter was very friendly and spoke perfect English, which is great because we just moved here. They have the menu in English and in German, and a wide variety of foods! The restaurant itself is in a quiet, secluded area and is very beautiful! \nWe ordered the escargot for appetizers and they were very good! Highly recommended! I ordered the chicken steak with spatzle, it was good and I think people who like chicken steak would like it but I didn't know that I do not like chicken steak . The spatzle is very good too! It is potato noodles, which is traditional Swabian food. My husband got the steak with chive butter and homemade and seasoned fries! It was delicious!! We also got the apple strudel with ice cream and it was amazing! This place is a little more pricey than cheap but it is well worth it and we will be going back for more!!
I don't have a bad thing to say about this place. They have awesome attentive service, the cocktails can sometimes take a little bit longer but that's because of what they all entail... the atmosphere is adorable, very industrial, perfect lighting, really reminds you of a speakeasy. It's a small place, so if you're doing dinner you may want a reservation. The bar tender who was there both times I have been was definitely on point- he took note of a certain way I ordered my Manhattan and then took some creative liberties to make it an even better one- I love this. We went on new years and had an awesome waiter, the food is really great. This is a great date spot... Yup, just go.
My mister and I have a yearly tradition of grabbing a bite to eat off Tryon before Bachtoberfest at the Symphony, and this year the Cellar was our choice. I vacillated with giving either a 3-star or or 4-star review based on some highs and lows of our experience, but decided to round up because I definitely want to go back. \n\nWe managed to snag seats at the bar, which we were excited about watching the bartenders work their magic.There are certainly some inventive cocktails on the menu, but it was tough to share the iPad between two people when we both wanted to oogle the drink list. It would be helpful to maybe stick to a traditional paper menu for the cocktails since those are more limited in choice compared to the beer list.The bartenders were super friendly with us, but we definitely heard them kvetching about co-workers and other patrons. This was amusing for us to listen to, but probably not the most appropriate behavior on their part.  \n\nEverything on the food menu sounded great, so we had some tough choices to make. We settled on the shrimp and grits, truffle fries, scallops, and brussel sprouts.We enjoyed everything that we ordered, but, the pacing was a bit off. The fries came out like almost immediately, the scallops and shrimp and grits came out maybe 15 minutes later, but the brussel sprouts didn't arrive for maybe another 20 minutes after that. We honestly had debated about canceling them because it had taken so long in comparison to everything else that we had ordered.
I'll preface this review to say that while this is not my \"go-to\" grocery store, I've been in a handful of times and it has never disappointed.  Typically I'll run in for an item or two if I find myself in the area, but most recently, I stopped by here to pick up a couple of balloons for a friend of mine who just had a baby.\n\nBonnie in the floral department helped me out.  She was super friendly and provided great customer service.  She went above and beyond to make sure that I was satisfied with my balloon selection -- I chose a cute \"It's a Girl\" balloon and a latex white one to go alongside it -- and put matching ribbon on.  She also showed me how to clip the balloons in the car so that they wouldn't be in my way while driving.  Thank you, Bonnie!\n\nI frequent the Safeway on Indian School and 48th St or the one on Camelback and 32nd St, but this one makes for a great option when I find myself closer to Scottsdale / Shea.  If nothing else, go have Bonnie help you with flowers or balloons... that will be sure to brighten your day!
Much better food than its predecessor.  Wide menu and decent prices.  Stoic service but the food comes out quickly.  Great for a business lunch as it has large booths.  Great egg foo yung and tofu dishes.
First experience with restaurant - very good! Placed a takeout order - ready quickly and accurate. Favorite was the crab rangoon, spring rolls and orange chicken. Will return!
The best submarine sandwiches you'll ever eat.\n\nDiBella's wows you from the beginning, especially if you are there during a busy time.  You are likely to be greeted by a line just out the front door, which is always a good sign.  Don't let it scare you off, though, as it moves quickly.  Once you're in the first door, you will see where they bake their bread which is one of the two secrets to their perfect sandwiches.  Through the second door, you're greeted by 1920s decor and artifacts.\n\nWhen you order, there is a very friendly \"Soup Nazi\" thing going on.  The person taking your order rapidly goes through several lists of ingredients that are somewhat logically grouped together.  If you are a newcomer, they slow down and do so with a smile.  But their \"all business\" attitude is what keeps the line moving.\n\nThe important part... the food!  I've only ever ordered the Hot Godfather (I should say the Godfather sub, prepared hot) and it is the best submarine sandwich I've ever had, and by no small margin.\n\nI have also given Jimmy John's 5 stars because they have perfected their craft - lightning fast, high-quality cold subs.  But DiBella's is doing something different (something more difficult to get right) and they've also perfected it.\n\nThe bread is an A+.  Beautiful shiny crust surrounds flavorful, perfectly tender but dense soft-stuff.  I usually get the \"everything\" bread, but sometimes get the seeded Italian.  It's all perfect.\n\nThe meats and cheeses are an A+, as well.  Flavorful but not overly fatty capicola is hard to find.  They have it here.  And they give you a LOT of it.  \n\nThe sandwiches are then cooked the perfectly correct amount, and dressed to your specifications.  No matter how high of expectations you come in with, the first bite of a Hot Godfather will exceed your expectations.\n\nFor sides, DiBella's has excellent chocolate chip cookies (with and without walnuts) and the best chips on earth, Miss Vickie's.\n\nIt doesn't get any better.
good sandwiches period plenty of meat not like jimmy johns or subway if you want a good sandwich with a little bang for your buck try this place
Decided to give this place a second chance after the GM reaching out to me. He seemed very concerned with the whole issue and wanted me to have a better experience. \n\nSat in the bar area and service was really good. My husband got the buffalo chicken sandwich and really liked it. Had a good flavor to it but not too spicy. I got the burnin love burger and thought it was delicious. \n\nOverall, the experience was much better than my last visit even though it was a to go order and this time I actually dined in.
When I brought my sesame chicken in to the lab today, it was met with a chorus of \"where did you get that,\" and \"oh, yeah, love cravings!\"  \n\nIt's that rare kind of place that has both nasty, american, super fried chinese food, and real, actually eaten by some asian people somewhere in asia food.  And it's dead cheap!
Wonderful experience all around! The atmosphere was perfect!  Photos of the rat pack, old Las Vegas and Elvis with great lighting and the old beautiful bar, comfortable seating make the difference! The ribeye steaks and salmon were delicious and perfectly cooked.  The crab cake was the best I've ever had!  It was huge and truly the best this 63 year old retired Colonel ever tasted!  We had two kinds of mushrooms that were perfect with our steaks. The creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes were amazing!! We had the velvet cake, key lime pie and chocolate moose and they just couldn't have been better!  The wine our extremely professional server Jay recommended was again perfect!   Do yourself a favor, go check out this wonderful experience, and ask for Jay!  We will always visit Vic and Anthony's when we visit Las Vegas!
ok I have a new favorite thing here- Pasta salad! I don't get excited about pasta salad but this was goooood pasta salad! Though I am disappointed the chicken salad sandwich wasn't dill-y like usual today :( Still one of my favorite lunch places!
How much do I love having a good bakery only a few minutes from my house? A lot. I've been to Dori's several times now, and have not been disappointed in the baked goods. The Danishes and apple bread I've bought for breakfast were delicious, as were the sandwiches I've had for lunch (chicken salad and turkey/avocado). The bread on those sandwiches was amazing, with such great flavor and texture, that when my cousin needed good bread for fancy tea sandwiches she was serving at a birthday party, I went straight to Dori for white and wheat bread. I heard several people at the party commenting on how delicious the bread tasted, and they were right. Can't wait to try even more treats here.
What a hidden gem in the north hills, literally! It sits right behind Adrian's Pizza off of Thompson Run Road. This is exactly what this area needed since there are a ton of chain restaurants and I am not a big fan of chains. I grew up in a small town that was filled with mom and pop restaurants and I always loved these types of places. I stumbled upon Wheelfish on Facebook one night and was so eager to try it! I have been looking for a good bbq spot and this place is it. \n\nIf you are looking for a place to grab drinks they have a pretty big bar area or if you are looking to grab drinks to go you can build your own six pack. \nThe menu is simple and I honestly didn't mind it being that way. I ordered pulled pork ($5)(quarter pound) and a side of mac and cheese ($5). The menu is a la carte so you are going to pay for your sides if you want them. The mac and cheese was homemade and topped with bread crumbs. Very creamy! The pulled pork was also very tasty and just enough for me. It also comes in a half pound if you are really hungry. My mom ordered a half rack of ribs ($13) with a side of curly fries. I did try her ribs and fries and I LOVED them both. The ribs were a dry rub, but they do have 3 different bbq sauces to add to your meal if you wish to make things more saucy. The curly fries came out with a special homemade sauce on the side and I wish I knew what was in this sauce because I put it on everything it was so good! \n\nI really loved everything about this place the rustic decor, the simple menu, and great food. Everyone, go try Wheelfish you will not be disappointed! Finally, a relaxing place I can go to that's so close to home!
Everything here is amazing. We had the onion rings,milk shakes & shared the nom nom burger which was literally the best burger EVER. The meringues are fun. The atmosphere is really cute.
Ordered for pick up and the food was pretty good! When the bag came out, it was huge and shocked us because we only ordered some lunch items and was given so much food! \n\nLOVE their rice and beans! It was so flavorful and delicious. The fish taco was pretty good, the sauce is where it's at, I'm obsessed with the sauce! There was a nice spice to it. The chimi was a little disappointing though. I don't know if it's because we ordered to-go so when the chimi came to us, it wasn't crispy or anything but it was a little on the soggy side.
Some of the best Mexican food can be found in my old home town of Las Cruces, NM, so I am particular about it. While Carlos has their own style of food, there are a few dependable items which are wonderful. Their margaritas are excellent, the spicy bean dip is authentic, and the appetizer folded, shredded quesadillas are very, very good. The chips are pretty much bottomless and the dip is good. The spinach con queso dip, while good, is really an american thing and not so much mexican. The service is excellent. The mini tacos are also very good. But I long for Las Cruces food...
Yep, you get what you pay for! Upon checking into my room in the \"Bungalos\" probably the worst rooms they have. I noticed a dead cock roach on the floor, went to the front desk and switched rooms. They put me in the Ocean tower, the room was not much better. The 1978 A/C unit sounds like a freight train rolling through your room, and when the room next door uses the shower it sounds like the pipes are gonna come through the wall. Not much of a casino downstairs, I would honestly be surprised if this place is still open in a year
Must wanted to say thank you to Lindsay and Kelsey from the bar. Excellent service and very attentive.\n\nMy Partner in Dining (PID) went here recently for a small lunch. It was about 11:30am and we ended up here by accident because my PID took a wrong turn. Definitely worth it!\n\nWe were immediately able to get seats at the bar. Lindsay quickly greeted us and took our drink orders. We got two pints of Blue Moon ($6 each) to start.\n\nAfterwards we ordered the honey chipotle wings with bleu cheese and a side of curly fries. The place was fairly busy, but it seemed that everyone was getting taken care of. Lots of birthdays were being celebrated so there was lots of singing.\n\nOur food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. The wings and fries hit the spot and went down well with the Blue Moon.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean, and able to accommodate larger parties. What's also great is the food is affordable. Yes the location is on the south end of the strip, but if you need some good old wings, you can't go wrong.\n\nOn tap I believe in addition to Blue Moon there's Coors and Red's Apple Cider (that's a first). There were others but I don't quite remember them.\n\nUntil next time, Wing Wednesday is every day!
This place is delicious for those who enjoy this style of pizza. It's fast but authentic tasting. Very friendly staff. A little pricey for what we got but it doesn't have to be and they have specials everyday. It's conveniently located by my house as well. Would make a nice casual date location as well.
I've had this place bookmarked forever and finally made it there for dinner before our most recent bingo UYE.\n\nI was surprised that it was such a small place - there are just a few booths and tables. I was very impressed by the prices, they are very reasonable.  They were offering $1 off the draft Peroni, making it just $2.50.  I dare you to find cheaper imported beer in Vegas!  Also, they had a couple of specials: A small margherita pizza, salad and drink for $8.99 or a large margherita pizza, salad and large drink for $13.99.  Both were great deals.\n\nI went with the Naples pizza, which is basically a margherita pizza with better ingredients.  It was delicious.  I didn't have any issues with the crust being burnt.  Although it came out very \"wet,\" which is typical - the nice guy who delivered it mentioned this and recommended that I let it set for a few minutes.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly, the prices were great and the pizza was delicious.  Hopefully I will make it back soon!
Got to say I love three lavosh pizzas!! So far the jungle is great and I have had great meals at all of there locations so far.. Arcadia location has chill atmosphere good hipster wait staff fast service menu is healthier than lots of places good place for all ages and tastes.
Good food + hip waiters/waitresses = Good times
When I first became a vegetarian I ate here all of the time. The food is healthy and delicious. Relaxing atmosphere. Food tastes so much better when someone else makes it. The happy hour prices are amazing, lots of delicious food and unlimited tropical iced tea all under $10!
Just ate the spicy chicken wrap, which was hot, packed with veggies, and perfectly seasoned. The portion was huge, probably 20 percent bigger than a Chipotle burrito, and two meals for $7.99 is a tremendous value, especially given how comparitively healthy Pita Jungle's entrees are. Also, the take-out order was ready exactly when it was promised.\n\nOne harsh bit of criticism: Don't be cheap with the pocket bread; one piece rolled up in foil is totally insufficient for a 7-10 oz. tub of hummus. If you're ordering you have to request additional bread or you're going to have some lonely leftover hummus.\n\nI haven't eaten in yet, but the atmosphere seems fun and diverse--everyone from shaggy haired hipsters to the Dockers-wearing crowd. And there's a bar, which is always helpful.
The beet salad was pretty good and my pizza was awesome, a little smaller than I would've thought but I wasn't disappointed!
You know a place must be special when you have people waiting outside (twenty, thirty minutes!) in the Charlotte heat just to eat breakfast. Once you enter, you realize it's not for the ambience, as the interior is unmemorable with dated food photos on the walls and tables packed into every inch of floorspace. But if you ask this girl, Original Pancake House, or \"O-HOP\" as my friends and I have always called it, is all about the food and is definitely worth the wait!\n\nI feel like you can always tell the quality of a breakfast spot by the coffee. And O-HOP has great coffee! Smooth, strong but not bitter, always piping hot and fresh and brought out with the old-school little metal pitchers of real cream.\n\nBoth my boyfriend and I were feeling adventurous that day, and the risks paid off big time. He ordered the Apple Cinnamon Nut French Toast. Before long a heaping plate arrived with large pieces of French bread, coated in almonds, with gobs of REAL whipped cream and homemade apple nectar syrup. I would have been jealous, except I ordered the Apple Pancake at the suggestion of our waitress, and that pancake was the star of the show.\n\nO-HOP's Apple Pancakes reportedly take an hour to make, but they have one cooking during brunch at all times because it's always being ordered so it is not an extra wait. Even if it were, again, it would be worth it! The Apple Pancake is a soft baked pillow of deliciousness, coated in thinly-sliced, sweet and tart Granny Smith apples that have been caramelized and glazed in cinnamon and sugar. I wish I had the words to better describe this extraordinary experience. This is a CAN'T MISS DISH!\n\nAll of O-HOP's items are cooked with clarified butter (ghee) and peanut oil. They use real preserves. Batters are made from scratch, and some mixes take days to develop. It's a true testament to the importance of details, because their food is truly divine. Don't let the ho-hum digs fool you, Original Pancake House  is a real diamond in the rough.
Always a great place. Food, service and experience is fantastic. As good as settebellos or pizza rock but half the price.
Ce charmant resto chilien doit absolument faire partie de votre carnet d'addresse. Nich\u00e9 dans un petit coin tranquille sur la rue Marie-Anne, La Chilenita offre d'excellents sandwich qui sauront satisfaire les app\u00e9tits les plus capricieux. Entre le Churrasco \u00e0 la viande et le Barro Loco, vous avez l'embarras du choix. Parfait pour casser la cro?te en fin d'apr\u00e8s-midi et rigoler entre amis.
I want to focus on the aspects of this restaurant: the food, service, and atmosphere.\n\nLet me say the food is phenomenal and that's what keeps me going back. Very sophisticated flavours with an attitude like no other. The prices could be a little lower but still, this is the reason there are people lining up outside the venue on weekend. 5/5.\n\nI really enjoy the people who work at Cantina as well. When I took my friends for late night drinks last Saturday, our waitor was entertainingly knowledgable of the food, what we should order, and was an expert on getting us to purchase multiple shots of tequila. The service was great, however it seemed like our waitor got caught up in attending to other tables and carrying on her welcoming ambience that she forgot to bring us one plate of food. This left us waiting a couple of minutes as the already brought food got cold. Leaving as well took a while. We asked for the bill a few times only to get told to wait a few minutes. 4/5.\n\nFinally, the atmosphere is something I wanted to quickly touch upon. The restaurant is small so having the place filled can make the restaurant very loud. To add to that, the Spanish music blasting doesn't help the conversation flow either. Be aware that at times it can be hard to hear the person speaking as they sit beside you. 4/5.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend Cantina if you're looking for a nice way to fancy-up quality time with friends or loved-ones. I'd seriously suggest giving it a try.
Friendly neighbourhood taco joint. Great service, nice people. \n\nOrdered the mezcal margarita but they ran out of freshly squeezed cane juice. No problem; the wine suggestion matched perfectly. Was looking forward to some cane juice though. \n\nTacos were small but delicious. As were the guac and chips. Blue corn, served warm, and made well. \n\nI sadly was not completely on board with the dessert. Flan was good, but wasn't too keen on the cheese \"crust\". Interesting execution, could be better. The masa-like cake was also interesting because of the texture, but the whipped topping was tasty. \n\nFun decor. Overall a nice time with an old friend.
Really delicious mexican food.  We ordered the flautas and chips/guac to start and both were very tasty.  We had a bunch of tacos and the favourite was definitely the shortrib or the lobster.  The octopus was delicious too, although pretty hot. I will definitely be returning.  The service was good too, and I was happy that they took reservations (although they do warn you that your seating time is for two hours max).
I have been getting my ice and water from here for what seems like forever. The water is always cruelest and clean and delicious. The ice is even more awesome because it has a cooler dump and will dump 20 pounds of ice straight into your cooler!!!
My experience here was unforgettable! Where do I start! This has to be the best memory ever! Dinner was amazing! It felt like a little Italy . My love and I were so happy there ,we ended up chit chatting with the couple sitting next to us. talking about how amazing everything at the restaurant was next thing we knew our tables were gathered the owner shared some amazing stories with us . None of us wanted to leave hahah.... Food was delic! And the experience was the best!
This used to be a great place for me and my wife. We used to eat here at least once a month. The food was great and service was awesome. Now not so much. It seems that there is a child seating people and they have no clue what to do. When we walked in it was busy and we we're told no reservations when we called. So we asked to be put on the list to be seated. Lol, this girl said we don't have a list. What do you mean. I asked well then how do you keep track of who's up next to be seated. At that point someone came in and walked right by me and said we have 2 and they got seated. I looked at her and said what was that. She said well you have a large party ok no problem  then how long will it be, then just as I asked some waiter came over and said what's the problem I asked how long it would be he said 45 mins. As he looked at me to be surprised and walk out not to return. I said ok we will see you then. He got all piss ed at me for some reason. So we went back at about 40 mins she said no table yet. OK. Another 30 mins went by she said sorry no table. So I said you just seated about 25 people as they walked in. Wt.... the answer well they just walked in. Wtf are you talking about. If you can seat 25 people as they walk in then you can seat are party of 10. She said oh we just gave your table away so it will be another 45 mins. So I went to talk to the waiter who told us 45 mins in the 1st place he said if you talk to me again im Calling security. I thought to myself wtf is going on here. We are now 2 hours waiting and guess what no table available. \n\nThis new management needs to get some real people in there befor this place runs into the ground. How do you not have a waiting list. It's so elementary for a restaurant. Stop giving your your daughter and sons a job and run the business correctly other wise it will run its self into the ground. \n\nBy the looks of the reviews it's seems this has become the norm for this place with no common sense on how to run a restaurant. And children running the show. Great job to the new owner. You really know how to run the place into the ground. \n\nGET A WAITING LIST. AND A NEW STAFF OF WAITERS. IT'S OBVIOUS THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT TO DO.
Great Mexicano Mexican. Great tacos and Aguas Frescas. Do not go to those other almost Mexican joints, get some real food straight from the source. The inside is fast food friendly and the tv is a little too loud, however you can always take it to go.
The staff was nice and the salsa was good but the buck stops there..the food itself was terrible.i got an order of carne asada fries w/everything and some red menudo..the carne asada meat was bland and sat on top of a pile of sad steak fries covered with just cheese sauce and sour cream (YES I SAID CHEESE SAUCE) and the menudo was just as bland as the fries..i wanted to like this place but my California roots and my love for authentic mexican food wouldn't allow it.
This is such a great value. They food is fast and tasty and the price is right! Their doubles are delicious, their patties have a lovely dough - that is light enough to enjoy and firm enough not to fall apart in your hand. The fillings for the patties are great; try the shrimp, its a real treat, as the curry goat. Go check it out when you have a craving. They have something for everyone! You can't go wrong.
They're not called Patty King without a reason since they do have one of the best beef patties in the city, except they're not called Patty King anymore, but Golden Patty?!  When did they change the name, or have I not noticed before?\nI couldn't search the name for them on Yelp, so checked in as Patty King.\n\nThe store is really small and on weekends is packed with customers.  They offer their famous beef patties and doubles, breads, plus a variety of Caribbean foods.\n\nThe service is usually friendly, but sometimes it feels a bit rushed.  Therefore, you better know what you want to order when you're next in line (or no patty for you).  Often there are 3 or 4 people behind the counter and they all want to take your order even if they're helping other customers. Talk about multitasking!\n\nMy visit this Friday afternoon, I had two people who served me. I ordered a beef patty as that's what I usually get as an afternoon snack while grocery shopping (kind of helps stave off from me buying too much food in the market).  Price was $1.40 for a pocket of delicious goodness consisting of a golden pastry filled with flavourful beefy yumminess. Oh so good!
Okay let me start off by saying that I've always wanted to come to a cat cafe so as soon as I walked by this one I was pretty much having a heart attack because I needed to come in. Three days later and I finally got to see the cats. There are some rules, you have to pay a minimum of 5 dollars to come in and touch the cutie pies, and no shoes allowed. They also give you a time limit since it's pretty popular. \nThe cats are so freaking adorable. I already want to take them all home. It is a cafe but honestly it's more about the cats. The coffee is regular so you're pretty much paying to touch the cats. The staff are friendly and it's definitely been an experience.
Going here for 34 years. Incredible gem in Mesa. best chimis ever.
This place is a hidden gem. My husband and I found it using Yelp and saw how many reviews it had. It is definitely worth all 5 stars. From the outside it looked a little sketchy, but we felt better when we saw people inside. We got there around 7:30 and there were about 4 other tables, by 9:00 the place was filled! The atmosphere and service is so much fun! And they have great happy hour prices, which start after 8. We will definitely be back!
Lunch box. Do it. Your mouth will thank you. It's cheap. It's tasty. The only thing this place is missing is a drive through.
This place has been opened for a long time.  And there is always a long wait during afternoon tea time.  We waited around 15-20 minutes for a table. Amazing noodles with beef and HK style French toast.  It was well worth the wait.  Service is quick and this basically is a place where you eat and leave right away.  The HK milk tea and lemon tea are amazing as well,  fresh and just right.
I'm a regular for their amazing vegan cakes. The Fashion Show location has a friendly staff and quick service. Their vegan Cuban sandwich is a favorite and their vegan nachos are a \"cheat day\" favorite of mine. Gluten Free cakes are great too - esp the chocolate peanut butter. Great for non-vegans as well.
Came here for dinner while traveling on business; I like to check out local sushi places where I go, and this one had pretty good reviews.  \nI would give this place 2.5 stars, if Yelp allowed half-stars, but I decided to round down, rather than up, because nothing really impressed me about this place.\nI ordered a big Kirin Ichiban beer, seaweed salad, small sashimi combo platter, and green tea mochi ice cream.  Turned out to be a big meal for one person.  The seaweed salad was much bigger than most places serve, which confused me, as I didn't want to fill up on seaweed.  It was $8.00, and had a sliver of crab on top of it.  Weird.  The sashimi was rather good; the small platter had 5 pieces each of octopus, albacore, fatty tuna, yellowfin, and salmon.  This is more sashimi than a typical small combo, and the price tag was higher, too ($28.00).  The individual sashimi orders on the menu were 7-8 pieces each, and most were $10.95.  What irked me was the albacore.  It had been seared in a previous life, with some weird spices, then chilled, giving it a hard outer crust and limp interior.  It reminded me of lunchmeat.  Not good.\nNot many sushi places offer the mochi ice cream - I was happy to see they had 'em.  \nOverall, decent quality fish, prices are rather high, chefs are pleasant...better than many sushi places in Phoenix.  I'm still searching for the sushi Mecca in that area, though.
Chat buffet went downhill, food was not hot and all the items they were out & I guess chef changed too as the food is below average. I'm super disappointed in freshness & also quality of the food. I might need to find a new Indian place. :(
Yummm. The cooks at this restaurant can cook up a delicious meal. Came here for dinner and am glad I did!\n\nOrder Scottish Salmon and was surprised they asked how I liked it- medium or medium well. Hmmm, how would I like me salmon?!? Asked for it well and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Just like red meat, it was cooked at the right temperature where it was soft and not overly dry. I was thrown off and can't say it was great, but my friends loved it very much. The balsamic rice was alright, pretty typical. But the eggplant was cook just as perrrfectly as the salmon. It was not mushy or still hard, right in between of both.\n\nMy friend had the Maine Lobster Pot Pie and don't be fooled as I was, it is much better than I imagine. It came out in its entirely- as in the pot still. The process is great, the server cuts the top off and reconstructs the lobster to the plate again. So your entree looks like a real dish and not just a pot pie. And for $85 it is well worth the money. And actually enough to not have to share. =)\n\nWe also ordered American Kobe Burgers and that was tasty. The glazed grilled onions were somewhat sweet and compliemented the dressing well. However the fries were not good. Way Toooo Much Salt. It seemed as though they threw in the whole salt container. That was a disappointment. How can a nice establishment mess up on French fries!\nThe Truffle Mac and Cheese is pretty good too. Not overly cheesy too. The top layer is salty as well. So to prevent the need to drink a gallon of water avoid the top.\n\nService was great. Very attentive.
Wow! I have never been to a sports bar with so many big screen TVs. I had the captains burger which is okay but I just did not like the flavoring. The fried cheese curds were pretty righteous. The real winner was the skillet brownie. Homemade with hot fudge and ice cream goodness. their Mojito was very average unfortunately. I will try to come back here to catch a football game next visit. Service was pretty good. It's pricey but what did you expect?
Bronze has the nicest staff! Every time I eat here I know I'll have a pleasant experience. I crave the guac and mole sandwich about once a week, and my boyfriend loves the chopped chicken salad with bacon. The cold-brew coffee is a must in the summer. As for lattes, if you're adding a powder, they're a little too sweet for my taste. A plain latte or cup of coffee is perfect (they use Colorado River Roasters coffee from Boulder City). I've even had them weigh out a pound of coffee beans for me to purchase for home use. Bronze is pricey, but once a week or so it's a nice indulgence.
TLDR: yelp coupon and government employee discounts; long lines most of the time; fantastic service and food handling; vegetarian and vegan friendly\n\nThis is a hidden find for visitors and locals alike. When do you ever hear, \"Hey! Wanna go to the LGBTQ Center for lunch?\" I hear it fortnightly if you're at my job at least. Who doesn't want house-made food at a fair price? I cannot even begin to tell you my excitement with this location. First off, get here quickly. They take customer service seriously. The con to this is potentially long lines during rush hour. But, if you can afford the time, wait in line. You need to enjoy this place, omnivores and vegans alike! From their made-from-scratch soups and salads, to their sandwiches and pitas, this place will satisfy anyone's cravings. Because it is located inside the Center, it is a shared space, so seating is limited adjacent to the gender non-specific, inclusive bathrooms.\n\nSo what do you order: Well if you're looking for color and presentation, please order the biz-ness salad. You will get your vegetable servings for the day! Want some meat in there? Try the LGBTQ and you will love the bacon jam. Want something more \"adventurous\" on the menu? Try the Tree of Life Pita with the vegan cashew \"crema.\" You will not regret coming here. Just don't forget to check-in or show your government ID for a discount. I'll sure be back for more.
Oh my, what are these guys doing?  Ridiculous!  I am here for the weekend in LV on a business trip.  Decided to try this place out.  The food is AMAZING!! I don't even know how you can make such a delicious sandwich and side.  Wow, I am speechless.  I tried the Complicated Order Sandwich with a side of Roasted Sweet Potatoes.  I wish these guys were in Orange County, CA where I reside.  If you guys ever want to open one there, I will partner with the restaurant opening.  Great food, highly recommend this restaurant!
I thought this place was better than most that I've been too.  When we first entered, my mother, sister, and I (with my 2 boys) were promptly greeted and seated.  Drinks were brought right away and were always replenished quickly.  The people there are really friendly and get to know their customers.  I was able to chat with our server and felt right at home! \n\nI thought the food was very well prepared and all was hot!  Items were labeled.  Basic fair for the type of restaurant it is, but great service and hot food go a long way in my book!
Every time I come to Vegas I come here, the food is amazing! I usually order extra just for the drive back to Salt Lake. No body really speaks English but they're good at understand what I want. If you haven't been here before you might want to take a friend who understands their language. Anyway I leave here always full and satisfied. Will be returning.
Everything we ordered was delicious! And the service was great! We don't speak Chinese and did just fine. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I think this is my favorite Chinese restaurant now. My only complaint is that they don't have lemon chicken because that's my favorite. But the sweet and sour chicken was amazing!
We went back the second time around it was just as good as the first. We had the stuffed jalape?o and some other sushi haut wanted to share some pics.
Once again, thank you Yelp.  My husband and I were looking for a sushi place closer to home and I found Yen on yelp.  We went there last night and were greeted by a sweetheart at the front door and ushered to a table for the bar.  The place was very clean, well staffed and had our kind of people in it.  There was a mix of older couples, bikers, teenagers and dates.  Perfect! We ordered 5 of their specialty rolls, sake bombers because it was happy hour and a raspberry sake the waitress recommended.  First off- the baked lobster roll is to die for.  It is a little pricey but has a generous portion of FRESH lobster. I have never enjoyed sake bombers before but for $5 during happy hour...why not?  The waitress recommended a certain Japanese beer to pair with the sake and it hit the mark.  I did try one of their martini happy hour drinks.  Do steer clear of these.  Not much alcohol and tasted like Kool-Aid.  After our dinner we wanted one of their higher end sake's and were encouraged to try the raspberry.  It was super delicious.  My husband does not like sweet girly drinks and he wants us to find the bottle to keep in our house. All in all\nGreat service + great rolls + romantic ambiance + fantastic drink specials + wonderful cocktails = 5 stars.  We will be regulars here now.
I love this place. Fantastic sushi, artfully prepared. Happy hour is great for cheap-yet-yummy sushi and killer sake/bombers, and all of the regular priced rolls are amazing. They recently expanded the dining room which helped with 1) the sound (it used to be crazy loud in there, but I still went because the food is so good) and 2) the crowd. It's popular, and honestly, if they hadn't expanded the dining room, I wouldn't give this place a great review because I wouldn't want to add to the competition for a table ;) but all that's solved now so there's no reason not to eat here. LOVE!!!
Dirty Dirty Dirty, I drive pass this place all the time and since love a good home burger I decided to try T Bones out. From the outside it looks like an awesome burger join but go inside and woe this place gives a whole new meaning to the word greasy spoon. This place looks like it has never been cleaned since it opened every thing is covered with grease from the fryers yuk. The food was ok, the burger was dry I could tell that i was just heated up and was pre cooked since you cant cook a burger from raw in 2 minutes. Ate thier once never again.
My boyfriend and I have given this place three chances but each time has been terrible service. The waitresses are straight up awful. Food was good.. but waitresses = garbage. Will never come back.
Yen is a fantastic choice for anyone needing their sushi fix. That's the best thing going for them, their food. Hands down the best eel I've ever had in town and close to the best oyster shooters I've taken. The green muscles are hands down the best appetizer I've had in any sushi joint. The chefs behind the bar are also very friendly and don't mind drunken people talking their ear off while working. The only problem with yen is that its really only worthwhile during the happy hour's they have and at that time it's almost impossible to get a seat without waiting and don't even try to get to the bar during those times. So your forced to sit at a table and be waited on by sub-par waitresses. Out of the 20 or so times I've been there I've had great service maybe 3 times at a table. Slow on refills and even refusing to split a check for my party on numerous occasions. But you take the good with the bad and I would recommend this place over any huge sushi restaurant with flash any day.
Yen is our go to place for sushi, even though we have a dozen sushi places closer to our house. The people are always so friendly and the have an amazing reverse happy hour from 8-close. We used to have to wait for a table, but they just expanded to accommodate more people. Sushi is amazing!
So far the best sushi I've had on the west valley.  Just moved from Tempe and was way better than most places on that side of town as well.\n\nCan't beat the happy hour, the only complaint would be how small the place is and it get's busy so the wait can be brutal when you're so close to such great sushi.
This place has dope dosas! They are so crispy, even though the norm seems to favour the soggy dosas in these parts. Definitely recommend the paper masala dosa (ask for the masala aka potatoes on the side if you want the crispness to last) and a mango lassi to go with it. Super affordable, yummy and filling.
Went for happy hour and it was wonderful. The Rosemary Fries and Shistake Pepper small plates were delish! The drink menu is amazing. The restaurant itself is very pretty, hip, eclectic, and clean. The bartenders make you feel at home. Did not eat dinner here but it looked great. The negative is that this place is pricey.
Amazing, as most other reviews say. Surprisingly reasonably priced for the melt in your mouth scallops, meaty and subtly sweet lamb chops and fresh lobster appetizer.
This place is great! I've been here twice, with slightly conflicting results. First time was superfab, the second time was pretty good. I think the difference was lunch & dinner? Maybe?\n\nFirst time was with a friend from my workplace during lunch. She got the taco salad, I got the grilled veggie wet burrito. fjadklfjafa;sl. The sauces on that burrito. Dayum. Halley also couldn't stop talking about her taco salad and how good it was, except when she was eating it. Then I had the most heavenly experience when I got their Mexican cruller, or basically kind of a smashed churro, fried & with sugar & cinnamon. I wanted like, 10 of these.\n\nWe had a great time talking to the two owners. So much so that my friend asked about catering for her wedding! (they can do it!!)\n\nSo the next time I went was with my husband Derek. We went pretty late, and instead of the two owners there it was one of the owners and two new-looking guys who seemed a little lost. Derek liked his 3 tacos well-enough, but said the meat was pretty dry (while Halley said the meat melted in her mouth). I got a grilled veggie taco salad. The grilled veggies were amazeballs and overall it was pretty good. We were both really disappointed by the chips & guac -- stale chips, and then two small plastic cups of guac ... one of which was basically a jalapeno puree, and not what I wanted at all.\n\nHoping the third time comes back to SUPERFAB.\n\nLastly, one of the biggest things keeping me from 5 stars ... everything is disposable: paper plates, plastic cups for water and for sides, paper plates, aluminum containers, etc. Not impressed. (NOTE: Jaime, one of the really nice owners, contacted me and said that at the moment, they're using disposable gear at night due to the drunk campus atmosphere. The late night crowd is a bit different than the lunch crowd. Makes sense, so drunk people: save your planet and stop taking stuff!)
We had our Yelp Book Club meeting in the great room of the Center last night.  This was my first time here and I needed my iPhone to guide me to the Center.\n\nI got a vanilla blended drink with a hot of espresso.  Quite tasty and very refreshing.  Had I looked at the menu more closely, I would have gotten an iced chai tea latte.  Oh well, if I'm in the area for some reason, I'll stop and get one of the sandwiches people rave about and the chai tea.\n\nThe Great Room was a good place for the book club discussion.  Our number was small--2--but Paolo and I had a good chat about the book \"Fresh Off the Boat.\"  There are a good number of tables, the seating is quite comfortable, and it was a fairly quiet place until just before we left when there were a number of kids around and the computers behind us were all being used.\n\nIt's a very busy place with a lot going on at the Center.
Port of subs is my favorite subs place! Freshly sliced deli meat and soft bread. They also deliver which is awesome! Definitely on top of the sub chain places.
Lord, where do I begin?  I have only eaten here once, but that was enough.\n\nMy father and I had breakfast there last summer mid morning and during the week so not at all busy.  We were seated promptly, asked what we would have to drink... and the wait began.\n\nFinally a server reeking of just returning from her smoke break acknowledged our presence and took our order.  We also noted that we were still just waiting for our beverages that someone said they were going to get.\n\nAnd we waited...\n\nBy the time our food finally arrived, I was out of water and my Dad coffee.  The waitress forgot our toast but would \"be right back\" with it.  Before we could say anything, she retreated to the kitchen as someone was calling her in the back.  She was never seen again.\n\nAnd we waited...\n\nFinally as we were finishing our meal, another waitress came with the check, conveniently while both of us had our mouths full so we didn't have a chance to ask for a refill or where the missing toast was.  Not a single word was even spoke.\n\nWe got up and paid to find the cashier on the phone having an argument with someone.  Never offered was a \"how was everything\" or even a note of the total due while still engaged in her heated conversation.  She just took his card and swiped it, laid the receipt down, and kept as she was before we approached her.\n\nMaybe this was a one off experience at the restaurant, but it hasn't resoundingly wanted me to rush back since there are so many options for breakfast in the area.  I personally know someone who worked there a very short time leaving because of wage and tips (hint: be thoughtful of your customers and that may change).  I pass by the restaurant frequently, and they always seem to be hiring signs out front so this could be the root of the problem with high turnover of any possible quality staff.
Diner food and there ain't nothing wrong with that! Without even reading the menu, my eye caught the specials board and I had the two eggs and pancakes special With coffee and tip, well under $10. A pretty good deal for a nice sit-down breakfast.\n\nI would absolutely return!
Craving for some comfort food?   This is your place.  We never leave unsatisfied.  Food like you would get at grandmas.  And a pretty hefty helping too.  The have daily specials that we can even order in the AM when we come on Sunday mornings.  \n\nThe pancakes and the french toast here are awesome!   My nieces can never get enough of them. It's a great popular spot that cam feel a little crowded on the weekends.
Very cheap and authentic Chinese food. The owner is very nice and the portion is very large.
One sentence to sum up this place: The Jack of all trades, master of none. This restaurant has 2 things going for it. Location close to campus and a large student population that values abundance over quality. Ninja doesn't need a lot of so so food. He likes tasty food. Sometimes too much so so food weigh binds down before sword fight.
It IS as good as everyone says! Especially those heavenly pancakes! There's more to this place than just the tradition, the food really is great. I have had the red fish sandwich, BLT, corned beef, Reuben, burger, strawberry pancakes, banana pancakes and cheese curds. Everything is delicious and you get your food FAST.
Four stars for Mickies just being what it sets out to be - a dairy bar. Not sure what more I can add to the sentiments shared already, but you really should fast for a day or two before heading to Mickies. And just resist getting a side of something because your entree is going to kick your ass several times over. Sure, pancakes (with fake maple syrup...this ain't vermont), home fries and a shake seems doable when you're looking at the menu and the still-very -low prices. But each pancake is the size of the plate, and turns to a well-what-we're-you-expecting tower of curing cement once it's buttered and syruped up. A word to the wise: get the short stack. And of course your milkshake is accompanied by the metal mixing cup so you have a refill at the ready should you not go into lactose shock too soon. Truly one of Madison's gems.
The one and only reason why we stayed here.....25 dollars a night for a room? Yeah....I'm a Hooters Girl somewhere else and we get a fat discount.\nNever again I'm going on vacation to a place where your room looks like your work....aahhH!!!! I came back more stressed out than I left!\nNightmare.\nThe only good thing, it's next to the strip so that's a plus...and the company I brought with me was the best.\nAnd to whoever said the \"self-respect\" thing....we actually wear more clothes than a lot of restaurants! If you are from LA....go to Saddle Ranch, you'll see what I mean!\nAnd how could I forget! The girls....OH   MY   GOD. Horrid....Hideous? Whichever you prefer! They looked like 35 year old single moms....ex coke heads... seriously.....no thanks
The price was very reasonable for three nights; thanks to Groupon  BUT the room was horrible.  The water didn't drain during our showers, ankle high water for a 5 min shower. Room service was no where to be found at times, even when we called. Walls super thin. Stains on the rug, holes in bathroom wall. Upgrades def needed.\n\nIt is what it is, we went to Vegas for a concert and my birthday so I wasn't planning on being inside of the room most of the time but I def expected more.
While we were staying at the MGM Grand in Vegas, we were looking around for deals on food and drinks.  We walked over to Hooters casino (which is basically right across the street from MGM on the back side).  We were happy we went!  The drinks weren't that cheap when we got there, but the environment was fun and the dealers were great.  The table games have a slightly lower minimum than many other casinos on the strip.  Plus, it doesn't hurt that we won $400 at roulette!  If you are on the southern end of the strip, definitely check it out!
Finally got a chance to do lunch and dinner here. I don't think you can go anywhere and beat the prices $7.99 and $9.99! I consider Aliante and GVR the best Feast Buffets in the Valley. The food is not bland. The roast beef is off the hook! The mash potatoes have pepper corns and they taste like butter unlike harden flour lumps I've had at other Feast Buffets. The salad bar at Aliante is always full of choices and the desserts are yummy.
I absolutely love Bronze! I've been eating here for 2 years now and every time it's delicious. You can order for delivery which is exactly what I did today. I work at atomic style lounge in the arts district so bronze is super convenient  for me. Their Vegan choices are so delicious you won't even realize it's vegan food. Today I decided to be bad and I got the what what sandwich which has turkey and pepperoni and omg I'm so glad I got it definitely recommend this place to anyone!
Oh my God, this place is amazing!  I just placed an order for delivery tonight (after having moved to Las Vegas today), and I am blown away by the quality and taste.  I just ate a sandwich that I think may qualify as the best sandwich (the California Turkey) I have ever eaten in my entire life.  No, really.  It was soooo good, and they didn't need to add tons and tons of ingredients to make it that good.  Everything tasted so fresh, the bread was absolutely delicious, and the oil and other toppings were in exactly the right proportions.  I'm not worried about blowing all my money on gambling in this town; I'm worried about blowing it all at this restaurant!  Actually, the prices are fair for such high quality.  Lots of options, too.  I'm sure I will try everything eventually.  \n\nI also wanted to give a warm shout out to my SUPER friendly and helpful delivery guy!\n\nI am lucky that this was my first meal as a Vegas local. I think I am going to be here or order here A LOT.  Hope they don't get sick of me.  ha   \n\nA+!
Great food! Prices are very reasonable especially for the large portions they give you. Very quick delivery. My only complaint is the chunky sauce only because i am a picky eater.
Another delicious meal from Bruno's in Peoria.  Not a fancy place, but the owners do a great job.  Thank you Ben and Leila, we appreciate you - and look forward to returning for another great meal in the near future!
When the bartender knows the name of all their customers and what they drink the minute they walk in the door you know you're in one of those good  neighborhood bars. We found the wait staff very friendly to us although we were not regulars , the cheese burgers were very good and the beer was cold what more can you ask for.
the japanese spicy noodle is not spicy at all, and the teast is teeeerrrrible!ii\n\nthe noodle is very thick, seems did not cook through.\n\nthe price is high.  $3 extra if you want to add meat.
I have been sad wishing the Soup or Salads were still open in our area. I was happy to find this place while out shopping.\n\nThe salad bar is stocked with fresh veggies and add ons. It's clean and inviting. The soup bar, bakery have a nice selection. It can get quite noisy, but I'm here for the food.
Yes, I am a fan. It is similar to \"Fresh choice\" in California, but I like the variety and freshness of the dishes. The salad bar is the same, so I won't go into to much detail about that. We like to go on Sundays after church for lunch.\n\nWhat I do like is there soup bar, 5 to 6 different types of soups are very delicious ranging from (chicken noodle, clam chowder, Irish potato lech, spicy chili bean, minestrone lentil), \n\nFresh baked goods are refreshed every hour. Corn bread, blueberry muffins, pizza, french rolls.\n\nThey have a stir fry section, which changes daily depending on breakfast lunch or dinner. I personally like the cheesy macaroni. They have Baked potatoes with all the fixing's. \n\nThe usual dessert par includes: fresh fruit, jello, pudding, chocolate/ vanilla soft server.\n\nbonus; on occasion a server will come by with fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.\n\nOne thing I noticed though, is even though this place is suppose to be healthy. All you can eat doesn't help from gorging myself.
The food at this place is very clean. You can sit at the sushi bar and have the choice of picking up the plate from the  sushi bar or ordering stuff on the menu.  I really enjoyed their beef tataki and spicy tuna. It can get a bit crowded during lunch time, so would recommend trying the place for dinner.
Conveyor belt sushi. It's a novelty (and more than a little gimmicky) but definitely worth a try. It is with this mindset that I went to Fune one night for dinner after seeing decent reviews online. \n\nThe ambiance is fantastic. You sit at the sushi bar where you see the chefs making the platters of rolls, sushi, and sashimi fresh in front of your eyes. The little boat conveyor belt is a nice touch, since it definitely gives a little more oomph to your meal to see little boats carrying your sushi around the sushi bar rather than your standard conveyor belts that you expect to see in a factory. Definite bonus there.\n\nThe fish was very fresh and very tasty, melts-in-your-mouth goodness. The chefs take a lot of care with the fish, and it takes them a great deal more time and effort to make the sushi than I had expected. The rolls with the sesame seeds rolled right into the rice were fantastic. Being able to choose exactly what you want and just grab it off the little boats was a really great experience.\n\nOne downside: nothing is labelled. Which means that if you are trying Japanese food for the first time, or you're not familiar with a certain dish or fish, you actually have no idea what you are eating. Since the chefs are always busy, I personally didn't want to interrupt them to inquire what I was having, which leaves some question marks as to exactly what I had just put into my stomach, no matter how good it tasted. Then again, ignorance is bliss.\n\nWhile it is a little on the expensive side, especially if you have a big appetite since the price starts adding up faster than you'd know, it's a worthwhile experience if you are looking into trying conveyor belt sushi.
I have been to several Red Robin's locations in the area. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and chilled. The staff is always friendly as a matter of fact the witnesses we had today we had last time we were here and that was about a year ago. Today me and my family came just because we had a taste for it. The Manager was very very friendly and as always the service was good. However no matter when I have went the food is only average. The image Red Robin portrays you would expect better than average food. Also if you are like me and like chili cheese fries but don't like beans beware they have beans in there chili. On a good note when it's your birthday they give you a free ice cream sundae and burger! OMG it's is so...... GOOD! We was here about a week after my birthday but I had to the end of the month to use my free birthday burger so that's how I ended up with the sundae. It was so good I didn't want to share so I had to buy my kids a free one. Over all a good spot but would be so much better if they improved the quality of the food.
Hamburger heaven!  Juiciest burgers ever and the best combination of toppings I've seen in a while.  I particularly like the black and blue burger I think it's called.  Comes with onion strings and blue cheese crumbles...to die for!  As with all Red Robin locations...endless fries....enough said.  I just wish the fries were of the shoe string type and not the steak style but no worries, still great.  My girlfriend and I stopped in at 1:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed so that's always a good indicator that the food is really good.  The service was fine, seating took a little bit, but nothing to really complain about and the food took a little longer than expected to reach the table but again, they were busy!\n\nStill one of my favorite hamburger spots...EVER :)
Just saw the Tedeschi Trucks Band at the Brooklyn Bowl. Wow!! What an unbelievable place to see a concert. We went early to grab some food before the show. Very cool sorta comfort food/bar food. I was boring and ordered a burger and my brother ordered the BBQ pork Sliders. Service was fast and friendly and the food was excellent. If you are a local you have to check this place out. I know that most locals want to avoid the strip most of the time but this is worth your time. All of the bowling lanes are situated right next to the stage and the floor where the concerts are so you can be bowling and enjoy a concert(we didn't bowl this time but we will next time).  The venue is small, probably would hold 2500 max and the floor is set up with no seating so you can wander right up to the stage if you want. It is hard to explain how cool this place is, I really hope it makes it here. Ticket prices are totally reasonable, I ordered my tickets online and paid $35 each( I saw them last year at the Hard Rock for three times that price and not that great of seats).  I will go back every chance I get.
As a self-proclaimed beer snob, we were in Toronto to check out the beer scene. Hungry, we finally arrived to Indie Ale House. To our dismay, the kitchen was closed from 3 to 5 pm; however, the greeter suggested Playa Cabana Cantina across the street for some good eats. What a suggestion that turned out to be.\n\nThe prices were a little higher for a typical burrito, but in my opinion, I got what I paid for. I ordered the CARNE MOLIDA PICADILLO BURRITO which is home-ground beef slow-cooked with guajillo-ancho-chipotle. The burrito had a beautiful presentation with green ancho-chili sauce poured on one half with a red, tomatoe sauce poured on the other half. Their sauces were fantastic. They also offered two house-made hot sauces. One was a habenero based hot sauce and the other was a hot sauce made from smoked chilis. Both sauces had a great spice. The smoked hot sauce went great with my dish.\n\nMy wife bought the Tres taco option - ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS. This took traditional tacos to another level. As mentioned, Playa Cabana has their sauces down. The liquid in which they braised the short rib was no exception. This option paired extremely well with the habenero hot sauce.\n\nIf you are in the area and have no problem with $14-18 for a delicious entre, by all means, try it out. (Not to mention Indie Ale House is right across the street with tastey brews for a good night cap.) When in Toronto again, I will defintely come back.
Very average establishment, especially late night.  I was here on a Saturday night and tried to order the late night tacos that are advertised on the wall but the kitchen was closed.  Fortunately the servers were very apologetic and kind and the michelada was nice and spicy.
When we came here we sat on the couches across from the bar because the dining area was reserved for a private event.\n\nThe service was decent. The atmosphere was decent. And the food was pretty good, albeit a bit overpriced but I'm in the center of the strip so I can't complain. \n\nThe burger we ordered was the rising sun and it was actually pretty delicious. Me and my friend shared it and the beef was tender and the sauce on it was sweet which went well with the savory patty. Their fries were also super crunchy which we loved. \n\nWe ended up ordering the cookies and cream shake because I mean since we're here we might as well get one of their epic $15 shakes. It came out and there was an entire ice cream sandwich on top. Needless to say I was very happy. They also gave us the extra shake that didn't fit inside of the milkshake glass which we appreciated! The shake itself tasted like a very basic oreo cookies and cream shake. You could kind of taste a hint of the booze but not a lot. The ice cream sandwich on top was pretty good, but it was very very messy.\n\nI'd come back here again with some friends from out of town or a fun night out. But it's pretty pricey.  One burger and a shake came out to 45 bucks. Spend an extra 5 and you could to go wicked spoon ;)
I came here looking to cure my hangover looking for some great tacos. Well I dropped by on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. They offered all you can eat for 24.99 or so so I went ahead and went with it. I tried a few things on there menu but all of it just didn't hit the spot. I am a huge Mexican Food snob especially coming from New Mexico but all of this food was just \"Gringo\" food there was no spice to anything and all of it was pretty bland.  Even if the food was bad the service should of made up for it but I was wrong. I sat at the bar area and was ignored the majority of the time. I kept having to get up and ask the hostess for things as well as to pay. I really wouldn't recommend coming to this place at all.
Best shwarma place I have ever been to!! The service is so friendly and the shwarma was stuffed to the brim with juicy chicken!
Went here for dinner the other night, and this place did not disappoint. Service was fast and friendly. I think (probably) the owner in the kitchen was greeting everyone that walked in. I ordered the shawarma wrap (~$10) and it felt like it was a foot long wrap. I had the usual veggies and toppings that go into it, which the guy loaded on, which already looked like a mini mountain. And then he comes back with all the meat he places it and smothers the wrap in delicious well-seasoned chicken meat. The dude making my wrap even suggested that I add the sesame sauce and \"special\" sauce, so I said, \"Sure! Why not\" Wow. Did not disappoint. Each bit was unique (mainly because it was so big and had to take small bites) you could taste each ingredient.\n\nSuper friendly, super delicious, and super stuffed. Overall, a great place to check out.
This place is great! The food is amazing, the size is an actual size of a football and the family that owns it are so nice! They are so warm and welcoming. At first we looked around the area and after pulling up the reviews on yelp we decided to give tho place a try and we weren't disappointed. Have gone back three times after that and ever time it's an enjoyable experience, they know how to make each customer happy besides giving them a great meal for a great price, just engaging in conversation is worth the visit, and like many people can agree with you'll most certainly be full and guarantee a \"bless you\" from the owner! Would highly recommend to anyone with an appetite and knows what great places taste like, not like the over hyped osmos or pita lands which can't compare to this place.
This is shitty food. Period. Maybe the chili cheese fries are good.....other than that, it's just kinda shitty food. Sorry.....
This was a major disappointment. We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was empty. The staff were talking loudly among each other the whole time we ate, and it was impossible to feel comfortable. I really disliked the food. Our grilled calamari appetizer was burnt, and the beet salad was overpriced and bland. The main course was equally awful. The chicken had a tough, chewy texture, and my pasta was way over cooked. For a meal that cost so much and was so dissatisfying, I think the restaurant deserves less than one star.
After 3 deliveries, 1 takeaway so far, I can definitely say this place doesn't shy away from using its spices. Good food esp their indo-Chinese. Biryani portions are crazy big! I really liked their Gobi-Manchurian. Very flavorful food. however please reconsider your spice level - their food can be very spicy but again equally delicious!
I wouldn't come here again. I am quite surprised that this place is in Macy's, and because it is in Macy's I had higher expectations. This place reminds me of a 50s diner with subpar food. The price was cheap, but so was the taste. The nearest bathroom to wash your hands is out somewhere else in the Macy's store that you have to hunt for. Trust me, it's not easy.\n\nAnd finally, I think this place still has its original customers eating here since it opened because the roll call looked like a bingo hall. Centenarians unite!
OMG, probably one of the worst Korean restaurant I've ever been to.  First off you can ONLY order lunch menu, I mean wat kind of restaurant that doesn't allow you to order other items on the menu. There is a dinner 5:30-8:30pm menu and late dinner menu.. that's just straight out stupid!!\n\nThe food took sooo long to come out (40mins.) and there was just 4 tables.  I don't mind waiting for good food to come out in this case it's just NOT good.  ONLY 3 side dishes given during lunch hrs. \n\nI ordered LA Galbi (2pcs) was so damn chewy, my mouth was hurting after eating the beef.  The flavor wasn't bad though. The beef bulgogi was just alright and the worst was the seafood tofu soup,  so bland(even I make it better at home) \n\nOverall they offered to waive my bill but I decline cuz I got a Groupon and wasn't planning on coming back. \n \nThe two ladies server was very nice and kept apologizing.
This place deserves 5 stars! If you order toppings they do not disappoint! I always get feta and there is always plenty! I love the convenience of ordering online and the delivery drivers are always nice! Eat here!
Best burger in Fountain Hills... hands down!!! The \"tap house burger\" is something else, 1/2 lb 100% angus beef patty with sliced prime rib on top with grilled onions and cheese  AMAZING. \nNot to mention they have 23 beers on tap featuring a wide variety of local brews. Your missing out if you haven't been to this place..
1 star is already too much for this place.\n\nI payed for \"VIP\" to only be there for no more than 2 hours just to watch a DJ. Just like everyone else that night, my friend and I had drinks from the bar. Needless to say it smelled like weed in there. I'm not going to lie the music was good and we were dancing, having a great time waiting for the main performance. \n\nAfter being told by the bartenders that Ashanti and Ja Rule came on at 9. I decided to head to the bathroom so I wouldn't miss anything. When I came back my friend told me that security from downstairs were staring right at us. I looked down at the 2 securities and didn't think anything of it.  BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING not only that we weren't the only people in that area!\n\nWith that being said, not even 5 minutes later 2 other securities tapped us and stated they needed to \"talk to us in a quiet place\" I didn't think anything of it so we followed. Just to lead us to the front door and saying do you know why we pulled you? I was completely puzzled and stated I didn't have an idea what was going on. He proceeded by saying \"you guys have been throwing ice at the crowd\"  I was so lost.  I did let him know I had literally just returned from the bathroom and he did not even acknowledge what I was saying  and added \"security has been watching you all night\" the  told us to leave.  There was no way I would've payed that amount of money to be kicked out.  They had no way to directly point fingers at us and if so. i would definitely like to see the proof of me throwing ice. This place is so unfair and I have called HR over and over and I have yet to receive a call back.\n\nBeing falsely accused of something we didn't do was wrong! I was so excited to be there for the first time and  unfortunately it was the last time.
My experience was just alright. I don't mean to burst anyone's bubbles, but the reviews of their fried chicken felt overrated. I'm always crazy about fried chicken and was very excited after reading all the reviews. Ordered 8 pieces with side of collard greens and red bean/rice, Adobo corns as appetizer. They were just okay.
Second year in a row starting off my Las Vegas convention trip with a stop at the Brooklyn Bowl.   This time it was lunch sitting out on the patio.   \n\nWe went pretty light this year starting off with the amazing potato knishes for the table and then a large caesar salad bowl with grilled chicken.  Good food, good service, the only complaint is that there was not enough chicken in the salad and it was a little dry in some slices.   But a great spot to have a meal, bowl some games, just hang out at the bar.
Blue ribbon restaurant has amazing food in here. I love their catfish dishes and delish collard greens
I walked past it randomly while trying to kill time at St Mike's and was really, really pleasantly surprised. I tried the double Pho Burger and it was great! The bread was able to hold the juices while not being too stiff or chewy, and the sprouts & mint tasted great on the burger. The pho broth isn't thick enough to really dip as a jus, but it was nice enough to sip afterwards. \n\nThe two guys there (I think one or both were the owners) were really nice and the prices are very reasonable (I think its like $2 for a small fries).
I just want to share about what an amazing brunch I had here on Sunday!  If you've got good french toast, you're most likely going to win me over.  But with the name Drunken Stuffed French Toast, I may just be in love!\n\nThe french toast is filled with lemon ricotta and bourbon spiked peach compote.  They were everything you'd want them to be and more.  Crispy on the outside, creamy dreamy deliciousness on the inside!  It comes with eggs your way and sausage or bacon.  Another mega plus....it's a Champagne brunch, YES!  You can also get a Bloody Mary....but I'm a fan of the Champage, so this was a no brainer for me!\n\nDid I mention they also serve up some delectable pastries and fresh jam to nosh on before your food comes out.  I am ALL ABOUT the complimentary bread baskets.  \n\nSlap down 20 bucks and you're good to go for the rest of the day because believe me, you'll be stuffed!
Ginger beer.... did you say Ginger beer.  OMG!  The specialty cocktails, while are limited, are damn good.  I love the Moscow mule which contains vodka, ginger beer, and some other good stuff.  I would go back to this place purely for this.... but wait the food is actually pretty good too!  The DH and I went here with a group of friends, so we ordered quite a bit, and shared everything.  So I'm pretty sure this place has some good food, and I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews?  We ordered the Shepherd's Pie, Fish And Chips, P.E.I. Mussels, Roasted Beet Salad, Scallop's, and Crab Cakes.  Each dish was better than the next.  My favorite was definitely the scallop's and the fries on the fish & chips entree.  The only thing I disliked was the batter on the fried fish, it was not crisp!  For shame.  The place is very unassuming, you would never think that they serve such fantastic food.  Give it a try!
I didn't know what to expect when coming to A n' A for a drink.  I was actually impressed, it was smaller inside than I anticipated, but felt like an intimate place to grab a drink or bite to eat.  I liked the decor - it just made me feel comfy.  \n\nI had the Circus Boy Magic Hat bottle.  It was really good - I like hops and wheat beer and this was a great combo of both.  \n\nThe waitress was very friendly and it wasn't overly crowded for a Friday night.  While we didn't order food here, the waitress mentioned that their Shepherd's pie is a big hit.  \n\nI would come here again and this time try out the food.
We love Mediterranean food and this is right across the street from our house. We have eaten there probably 5-6 times. It has progressively gotten worse. They give us a 20% coupon so we use it. I feel like they decrease the amount of food if you have a coupon! \n\nThe last few times the portions are extremely small. The final straw? I ordered the shrimp kabob because they were out of their daily deal (at 2pm!). This dish is $10 and there were 5 shrimp, a scoop of salad, a scoop of rice and HALF a pita. The shrimp were cold and tough as nails. And their sides? Go ahead and order one. You'll pay $3 for about 4 tablespoons of whatever it is that you ordered. \n\nOur first experience was wonderful, but we've spent a lot of money trying to recreate it. NEVER again.
I've been coming here every week for over 2 years and it's honestly one of my favorite breakfast spots in the South Tempe/Mesa area. They have amazing customer service and bomb.com breakfasts. Highly recommend the O'Pear Omelette, Chipotle Breakfast Burrito, and the Breakfast Salad (which is actually a delicious, gargantuan parfait). T.C. Eggington's does get busy on holidays, so be sure to get there before the breakfast rush!!!
Allgemein\nEin gem\u00fctlicher und vor allem leckerer Restaurantbesuch. Insgesamt kann ich das Restaurant nur empfehlen.\nBedienung\nDie Bedienung war freundlich, sympathisch. Der Besitzer sehr famili?r, so dass man sich gleich willkommen f\u00fchlt und die Kellner waren aufmerksam (mein Glas war nie lange leer) und zugleich angenehm zur\u00fcckhaltend (die Teller verschwanden fast von allein).\nDas Essen\nIch hatte ein Pf?nnchen mit Schweinelende und dieser phantastischen So?e (ich glaube es war Metaxa-So?e). Ich bin normalerweise nicht der Typ, der So?en noch mit etwas Brot tunkt, aber hier musste ich einfach und Brot hatten wir reichlich, da wir auch extra Zaziki bestellt hatten. Der Zaziki war prima, dass er nicht nach Knoblauch schmeckte, wie eine vorhergehende Kritik sagte, kann ich nicht nachvollziehen.\nDas Ambiente\nDer war sch?n hell, angenehm gro?, ordentlich und sauber. Falls es nach der Neuer?ffnung chaotischer gewesen sein sollte, ist davon nun definitiv nichts mehr sp\u00fcrbar.\nSauberkeit\nWaschr?ume (finde ich ja immer besonders wichtig) und Gastraum waren sauber und der Blick in die K\u00fcche, den ich erhaschen konnte, zeigte dort das gleiche Bild.
Hole in the wall = delicious, culturally accurate food.  This place serves delicious Thai home cooking.  \n\nThere were five of us that ate for $10 each.  Soup, salad, chicken kabob, chicken yellow curry, pork ribs, chicken spring rolls, Philly cheese steak with red curry sauce, and pumpkin custard with coconut ice cream.  SOOOO GOOOOD!\n\nThe menus were sticky, but who cares?  That comes with being a delicious hole in the wall restaurant.
It's quirky, it's different, it's tasty - I like TBAS. \n\nThe buffet is the main show and offers a nice selection of curries and other items that are solid in flavor and quality ingredients .  Also, the owner is very attentive, offering fresh dessert and sometimes extra items arrive at the table depending on what she happens to be working on in the kitchen.  Can't recall ever leaving unsatisfied.
Food was even better the second time in. If you order anything off the menu and like it really hot and really authentic, ask for it \"Thai Style\". This lady really knows how to cook real Thai food!
The line went all the way to the strip while waiting for the William Singe concert. The bars had small signs that read \"cash only\" which should have been bigger because it having a black back drop doesn't help with it being noticed but more of an inconvenience for customers. The noise quality was great during the show.
Caught my first show here last week when The Wailers were in town (so that's what the fog advisory in Vegas was-the city was just being hot boxed) ;) I kid, I kid, anyway, so naturally it was a great experience as it consisted of seeing live music by musicians who have played with Bob Marley, but being at Brooklyn Bowl made it even better. Here's why: for starters the staff was nice (which is rare in venues like this as most bouncers are trained to be dicks). Meanwhile we got there hours early thinking it would be packed, and though it was a good sized crowd the layout of the venue doesn't leave you feeling like a sardine stuffed in a tin can. Between the bowling, multiple bars, restaurant area, and giant patio overlooking The Linq we stayed entertained until showtime. The crowd couldn't have been more diverse and chill (though I realize this has more to do with the band than venue, but still, it enhanced the overall experience). Though the poor staff was scrambling trying to get people to stop smoking weed inside - but they weren't aggressive about it and I never saw them kick anyone out but rather just made them put it out. Perhaps they caught a contact high? (kidding). I'm super short and always have trouble seeing over people's heads at concerts, but either marijuana stunted everyone's growth there or the stage is tall enough to allow the little people in the back to see. As for the food the portions are MASSIVE! The waitress warned me about this so my dude and I shared a meal vs having leftovers we had to drag around all night. The prices reflected the large portions, but then again any place on the strip that has to pay concession fees is going to have to jack up their prices to make a profit. And as for The Wailers, they rocked! Tickets were only $30 each too which I thought was cheap to see legends. The moral of the story, or review rather, is that if an artist or band you like comes to Brooklyn Bowl, you should go!! One Love!
I grew up in New York. I grew up on Pizza! I know what good Italian food is.\nThis is not it.\nSauce is watery.\nPizza crust has sugar in it. I asked. They admitted it.\nEnough said.
I am a huge Fleming's fan and I found myself a little let down at the West Gate Fleming's. The service is always perfect here. We had a larger group and I think they did an amazing job making sure we were all happy. \n\nThe Food: We started with oysters as our appetizer and they weren't too far off from the best I have ever had. Ice cold and flavorful! Shoot away. I usually pass on salad or soup. I get salads elsewhere. This is my carnivorous place. I ordered the filet mignon med rare and it was cooked to perfection. I prefer a nicely peppered, salted steak cooked to perfection. I am not the soaking in butter steak guy. Go to Ruth Chris for that. We ordered the Fleming's potatoes and asparagus as our sides. The potatoes are a legendary staple and the asparagus is always slender and delicious. \n\nThe Drink: Here is my one downfall. Almost as important as the steak are my Martinis. Usually you will get the best martinis at steak houses. They shake them a little longer and the bartender usually knows how to properly use vermouth. Well, my first martini was more like a half of a martini. It was also slightly chilled. My second was a full martini, but was so over vermouthed that I almost gagged. Slightly chilled as well. When you pay more for a steakhouse martini, you kind of expect more. \n\nI will always make Fleming's one of my steakhouse go to's. May just have to give a little more direction on the martinis.
There is much more than meets the eye. Tucked away in a very popular touristy area of Toronto, Barberians Steakhouse is as good as it gets when it comes to quality food and service. You walk into a very narrow dimly lit entrance with a small bar and coat check that can get very crowded when more than 5 people are packed in. The restaurant is deceptive however, Barberians has a beautiful wine cellar in the basement, a secluded room upstairs and three separate dining areas on the main floor. When we visited this Toronto landmark we sampled from different areas of the menu- the filet mignon, rack of lamb and salmon steak. To start us off they offer garlic bread and pickled vegetables, a great pre-meal nibble to tide you over before biting into a juicy chunk of meat. The food itself though was phenomenal. Filet mignon was served rare wrapped in a succulent thick cut of perfectly cooked fatty bacon. The salty bacon and juicy steak married together create a perfect bite and the loaded baked potato just makes the plate undeniable, this is worth the $60 price tag. The rack of lamb served medium well comes with four delicious lamb shanks. For all the talk of steaks, the lamb and salmon were both pleasant surprises, and items we will definitely keep in mind when we return. And yes, we will return. Do not miss out on this gem of a restaurant, one of the best Toronto has to offer.
Tasty and freshly made food at a great price.  Being from Los Angeles we are naturally picky about food quality and China Lite does not disappoint.  Ma Po Tofu, Curry Chicken, and Beef with Snow Peas tasted great.  Definitely give this place a try.
Worst place to come eat.  My fist time here to this location and the last time.....\nKids running around no one tells them anything. Rice hard tastes a day old, pico de gallo no flavor also tastes old, chicken tooooo dry, flies flying everywhere. Location dirty and very loud. I DO NOT RECOMMEND This location at ALL....
A fantastic little takeout place! Great placement- I can pick up a few groceries, maybe some liquor if it's been a rough week, and some great food all in the same plaza. Very clean, polite attendants, but definitely not for dine-in spot. All the dishes my friends and I have tried have been a success. The crab rangoon especially! Keep an eye out for those specials- they're a bargain!
Excellent food with decent prices. Portions are  big.  Their fries are delicious.    I would recommend the gyros,  Greek salad,  and the wings!
After filling my belly happy with pizza from across the street at  Aiello's Pizza.  I spotted this little cute bakery and decided that we had to go in.\n\nWe walked in and were happily greeted with the smell of fresh bread, which we were told was made daily on the premises.  \n\nThe display case showed all of these beautiful and yummy looking desserts but we decided to go with a snicker doodle cookie and a chocolate chip cookie.  They were amazing! Nice and soft and had just enough of the ingredients that make a good cookie.  It had a lot of chocolate and the snicker doodle was nice and soft in the middle.  \n\nWe got to meet Tammy and she was a sweet woman who was very proud of each of her baked goods.  I want to try their cupcakes but they are by order only so maybe i'll have to make up an occasion to go pick some up.
My office ordered lunch from here for a group meeting. It was a \"meh\" for me and not just because I'm not crazy about Italian food. Firstly, there were no sandwiches. Apparently the catering/delivery menu doesn't offer sandwiches and only offers salads, pastas, veal and chicken, etc. \n\nWe had veal and chicken parmigiano, pasta pomodoro, lasagna, and green salad. The salad was fine. We all thought the veal and chicken were too salty. The veal was tough. And the pastas were nothing to write home about. \n\nHonestly, I just don't get the appeal with Italian restaurants. I can make pasta so much better at home that isn't just overly salty tomato sauce and way too much cheese. I don't understand why people pay for pasta. That's the easiest thing to make at home and it's dirt cheap. Restaurants love when you order pasta because their margins are huge on those dishes. Order a dish you can't make at home or that cost the restaurant more to make. Rant over. \n\nTLDR: It was meh Italian food.
Probably the worst location. There was hardly anyone there at lunch and the service was painfully slow.  Not to mention this is the only location that cant get the breading to stay on the sandwich.
For the price I was paying I was expecting a decent bowl of ramen, what I got was not that. I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen and some sashimi. Most of the reviews here had mentioned about the bad service, however I didn't notice it at all. The service wasn't impressive but it wasn't bad either. The noodles were really eggy and the soup was creamy but didn't taste like tonkatsu. Appearance-wise it looked messy, like they just chucked the the toppings in it as the yolk of the onsen egg wasn't as appealing as most ramen places. The food was really mediocre.
Very disappointing visit\nTenderous rib ramen for $9 - ribs were not tender at all. The noodles were similar if not worse than the stuff you can get from instant noodles. The spiciness level was from 1-5 and 5 being the most spicy. Tried level 2 spiciness and it was indeed very spicy. The Tonkotsu ramen was $8 and it wasn't anymore impressive. It came with thinly sliced pork which tasted bland and flavourless.\n\nThe worst part of the meal was the side order of octopus for $6. There were four slices. It was served on top of some noodles and soup. Did not like it at all. It had no real taste and so not worth the $6. It was so bad that I would not eat it even if it was free. Meals came with complementary salad. \n\nAt least service was good but thats the only positive comments I can give this place.
Pretty decent food & Got it delivered within less than an hour. It's Vegas, so I didn't expect much from this place, but I was craving Thai food. It's very convenient that they do deliveries! We need more restaurants to deliver.
Never before on the mainland have I had sushi that has made me stop and really, and I mean, REALLY savor the flavors. Like the world slows down \"Matrix-style\", grinds to a halt. It's that good.\n\nThe last place that did that to me was a small place hidden in a business complex in Maui called Sensei, and since then, I have not had that experience.\n\nUntil now. Run out of strip-mall, a Korean Chef named Paul runs Yen Sushi & Sake Bar, and creates some of the most interesting and delicious sushi I have had the pleasure of having.\n\nFirst off, the nigiri is very fresh, we had Spicy Scallops , Uni, & Smoked Salmon. The Spicy Scallops were exceptionally surprising, because the spicy sauce was not mayo-based, like EVERY OTHER SUSHI BAR EVER does. The result was nothing short of amazing.\n\nThe smoked salmon was melt-in-the-mouth delicious, and the Uni ranks as the best I have ever had. All roe, very sweet, and not over-powering at all.\n\nFor their Maki, we had the Heart Attack, which is basically the greatest Jalapeno Popper I have ever had. Extremely spicy Jalapeno, spicy tuna, real crab, and some sauces, deep-fried. Decadent.  Delicious.\n\nOur other roll was one that was a mixture of fish, I believe tuna, mackeral ,crab, mountain carrot, a few other veggies, and some eel sauce. Very fresh, and incredibly awesome.\n\nDelicious tea, and free miso, on top of an amazing atmosphere and an incredible chef, have made Yen the ONLY sushi bar that I will continually come back to in Phoenix.
Been two to three times and liked it very much.\n\nPro's\n- chips and salsa really good.  Significantly better than the usual fare\n- pulled pork was super!\n- atmosphere great\n\nCon's\n- servers okay. I wouldn't say overly helpful.  So this was/is a letdown \n\nI will continue coming here.  Good value!
A pleasant Oasis of quality, affordable Mexican cuisine smack-dab in the middle of fast-food hell, I found The Blue Adobe to be a refreshing break from the seemingly endless array of franchise-clones that plague every corner of the greater Mesa area.\r\n\r\nMy first visit to Blue Adobe was immediately following a 14 hour drive from San Francisco with my ladyfriend Tassie and two drugged-out cats that somehow managed to howl most of  the way down.  We were tipped off to the place by another colleague of mine that had moved to Sun Valley about three years prior.  I was a little worried when I saw the establishments Howard-Johnson's style exterior, but all fears evaporated when we entered what I consider to be a first class effort at creating a great dining environment, and doing so without exuding the slightest bit of pretentiousness. \r\n\r\nThe menu was pretty interesting too....it was creative without resorting to obnoxious San Francisco-style creativity where the menu description gives little clue as to what you'll be served. To the contrary...the menu did a great job of describing traditional Mexican fare, skillfully presenting additional nuances that came across as tempting details rather than vague liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe food was great...tasty, and with several marks of distinctions that set it apart from anything else I've had in the Mesa area.  Skillful presentation, creative seasonings, and the absence of excessive fat were among it's strong points.\r\n\r\nWe went here twice, and both times we sung it's praises.  But Tassie returned here with her relatives one day, and not all went well.  The staff was friendly as usual till one party showed up with a infant/toddler.  It took eons to get a high-chair, and from that point on the level of service went from warm-and-fuzzy to cold-and-distant.  I still give it thumbs up for grownups....but reports from afar tell me that this place is anything but kid-friendly.
This place was a welcome addition to NW Vegas! before this place opened i had to drive all the way down to Rincon Criollo. there are very few Cuban restaurant in Vegas but it's awesome we have at least 2 good ones. The restaurant is clean, the staff are friendly & the food delicious. The location could be better but worth looking for.
hello foodies  , sorry for the  late reviews  anyway I WANTED to eat a corned beef sandwich before st patrick day  ( day before ) so i took my beatfuil mother here as well we got there around 530 pm  we got the rubens (8 oz) that the standard weight , BUT SINCE I LOVE CORNED BEEF  ,.i got a extra 4 oz  added to both of the sandwich  (12 oz ruben WOW ) it was so tender  the meat  perfectly stacked in layers ,and the bread excellenly toasted to perfection  i had a gree n beer ,the beer was the freshest of any bar ,and it was  COLD !!!!!!!! temperture  not like semi  cold beer from a tap ,this was excellent  place to go   we had the bartender with the blonde hair  very pretty  she was very nice handle the food and the beer and she seems quite  nice  and she cared  , i would be back when i  getmore money  ,i heard  they have woderful corned beef everday of the year  that top of the moring to you  ,the noise level was a little hecked  and the lighting should be a little brighter   ,the booths where very roomy  that will hold a big and tall person  take care
Stopped in for a drink and some food and was instantly greeted by the friendly bar tender Bobby. I wasn't sure what cocktail I wanted but I knew I liked gin. He mixed me up a cocktail that not only looked great but tasted great as well! I came in a little before they opened and bobby made sure to make me feel comfortable at the bar while I waited for them to open. I will surely be back!
When the restaurant only has one menu, it means something. They have expertise in what they cook. The salad was fresh and lettuces were crisp and young. The beef was so tender and juicy. The dessert was the best and reminded me of the best choice cream I have ever had before.
Had an incredible meal at the Blue Adobe! Service was a bit slow at first, but our meals hit the table before we could even finish the chips and (YUMMY) salsa! I had the meatloaf special, and it was outstanding- the loaf itself was delicious, but the sauce really took it to the next level! Not to mention one of the best potato pancakes I've ever had! My boyfriend had the chimichanga and barely came up for air between bites. I also had a Prickly Pear marg, and they definitely did not skimp on the tequila. We will definitely be back!
Great food and friendly staff.  We had the awesome catfish and fried chicken with sweet potatoes, red beans and rice, mac and cheese for our sides and of course the meal came with corn bread.  Parking was nice and close, the place is clean with a large area for seating.  We will be returning and recommend Side Chix to our friends.
A friend from London and I went because he wanted old school Vegas. He got it! This place was great! I loved the pictures on the walls. \nThe food was outstanding. I got the porterhouse (my favorite cut), it was cooked perfect and mouthwatering. All the servers were attentive and knowledgable. \nI highly recommend the place!
When was the last time you had a meal and commented \"this tastes as good as when I had it the first time\"!  I imagine not very often, maybe never.  When I arrived in the valley some 15 years ago I was visiting downtown Tempe on Mill St.  I happened to stop into an interesting restaurant called Saki's for dinner.  Checking the menu I saw they had a dish call Miso-Sake Sea Bass, that sounded delicious.   I gave it a whirl and it was straight out fantastic in every way.  Buttery melt in your mouth fish with its edges seared in a miso paste and nori flakes sprinkled over the top.  Accompanied with Hawaiian Fried Rice and a salad that had/has the best onion-soy dressing ever it was a most memorable meal.  This was almost 15 years ago; I had the same meal last evening at Kona Grill in Chandler and commented the opening line in this paragraph.  Way to go Kona Grill, as I say about old soul records, it just gets better with time.
Been here two times so far food has been consistent and very tasty. Staff has been very nice and courteous. The place looks really nice and interesting. It's a coffee shop setting which is supposedly used in making a fox 5 series. The couches are very comfortable and each table is a different style. Soltani is my favorite.
Stopped by at about 5pm-6pm on a Saturday, wasn't too busy, had two cheese enchiladas, was pretty good. Also had a killer margarita on happy hour for $4, wasn't too bad at all, was pretty good actually. The food was pretty good, their salsa is pretty odd imo, they had wood-burned flavored salsa that added to the food, but then again was not your everyday salsa that you'd expect. Kind of hit and miss on the salsa.\n\nOther than that, the cheese enchiladas were pretty darn good. They kept refilling the water cups pretty fast and the waitress was really good at keeping up tabs with us. \n\nOverall a pretty good Mexican food experience.
Remains my FAVORITE New Mexican style Mexican food place.  GREAT drinks, and fantastic food. I have NEVER had a bad meal here.  Tonight had the sampler appetizer with lobster dip, shrimp, and some of the best crab cakes ever.  For dinner; the tenderest steak and a side chicken enchilada--wonderful.  It's the various sauces that they make that enhances ALL of their food.  For the sea food they NEVER use imitation and the pieces of lobster and crab were LARGE. The prices are a bit on the higher side but for the quality of food I'l keep going back.  Love their margaritas and the Ferrari is my favorite.  Service is EXCELLENT and all of the staff remain some of the friendliest ever.  This location---there is more than one Blue Adobe--remains the BEST.
wow, i ain't staying here no mo.  they going bankrupt & not putting money into routine maintainance.  my room had no bathroom trashcan, 3 lamps didn't work, no 'do not disturb' sign, the air conditioner was a dinosaur that kept me awake for hours, $8.50 resort fee per night & they deactivated my room key when i was rushing to my room to take a dump.  i like the casino floor & comedic entertainment
I was hungry so I pulled in for a bite to eat not expecting much. The service was so great and personable,  and the food was great too. I had a gyro and it was one of the best I've ever had. This is now one of my go to places for breakfast and lunch when I'm in Charlotte.
Mesa does not have a lot of fine dining, so Blue Adobe is really a gem.  I love the Vegetarian Chimichange and the fish tacos.  But perhaps my favorite part of the meal is the dinner salad.  They really know how to put together greens.  I highly recommend the entire experience.
This place was amazing. Delicious food at great prices and everything seemed to be fresh. The only reason I didn't give it give stars was because of the cleanliness of the restrooms. Other than that, I would highly recommend it!
It's the real Greek deal. Lamb Beef Keota was fresh. Basmati rice was cooked to perfection. Tatziki sauce was just right & complimented the food perfectly. \n\n3 kinds of hummus available. Roasted red pepper, jalapeno, & plain. All very tasty with warm fresh pita bread.  \n\nPrices were reasonable & parking convenient. Can't wait to use their catering
I have always wanted to write a review for this places and am recently new to yelp.  I have been coming here for years and it is my favorite lunch spot in then Phoenix area.  Wonderful Greek good gyro plate with the rice and Greek salad on side all wonderful.  Great flavor and good size portions.   To top off they do the Chicago thing.  Only been to Chicago once and loved the food there, and this reminds me of it.  Chicago dog is a must have item.  Best Chicago dog in town.  Double boom
If I could give negative stars I would. \n\nOrder #1 for delivery...Never got it.  After calling the restaurant the owner kept saying 5 minutes.  Never did receive the order\n\nOrder #2 for delivery...WRONG ORDER!  I had a craving and decided to give them another chance.  After waiting 1 hour I called and got my food about 10 minutes later.  The only problem was that it was NOT my food!  \n\nI believe I'm done with them.  Back to Chopstix I go.\n\nUPDATE: Owner called me 2 1/2 hours after my order and says that before refunding my money they are going to come and pick up the food!  1) I did NOT eat the food 2) I put it in my trash can 3)They want to make sure that they get everything back before refunding.   \n\nThen she tried to tell me that I owe $12 more.  For what?  So I can have my initial order recooked.  LOL  Sorry guys, but I ate dinner an hour ago.  \n\nSo they are on their way to pick up the food that I did not touch and put in the trash can, so they can reimburse me.  Interesting business strategy.
We ordered Pho, Bun, Crispy eggrolls, Vietnamese coffee...all delicious. Good size portions. The servers were pleasant, helpful, and efficient. We were too full for dessert, but we'll definitely return.
This place has pretty good pho. One thing I really like about the menu is the build-your-own option. It's either a small size or large and it comes with 3 meat choices out of the 8 they have. \n\nI enjoy tripe in my pho and lately most places I've been to doesn't really do it to my liking. But Sidestreet's tripe was tender and had the right amount to it, in ratio with the brisket I added to my bowl. \n\nThe Vietnamese iced coffee I had was tasty and actually tasted like coffee and not just sugar. It's pretty strong too, so I recommend you don't have it when you plan on sleeping early. \n\nOne funny note: our waiter was really attentive and conversational. As he was refilling our waters, a couple came in at 9pm, and hour before closing on a Saturday night. And he mentions to us, \"here's a tip, don't come in the last hour before closing because we will curse at you in a language you will not understand.\" I found it funny, but most people would be triggered at the fact; I admired his honesty. \n\nBookmarked this place because I plan on going again.
I was very excited to try this place because it had 4 1/2 stars. I looked at the menu and it looked enticing.  We ordered Pho and Wonton soups, fresh spring rolls and fried egg rolls. The soups were just average and the flavors were not rich to begin with. Even adding all the veggies and spices couldn't give it the rich flavors we were looking for.  The fresh spring rolls were lacked crunch and the peanut sauce needed more hoisin sauce.  The fried spring rolls had a weird texture and the flavor was not good.  The sauce was was lacking in fish sauce as well. I would not recommend this place based on my first visit.  The place was packed and I wonder if they were tasting the same flavors as me.
This is a poorly managed establishment with decent food. When I arrived, they claimed we didn't have a reservation. After showing them my phone log, showing we had spoken a week earlier to make the reservation, we were seated after a 20min wait. When we tried to use our Groupon to pay they first said it was expired (it doesn't expire until mid march) then changed their tune claiming they didn't even sell them (despite being the establishment shown on the Groupon). False advertising is a pet peeve of mine. You can get better food elsewhere without having to deal with rude and lying managers.
This place smells like ass and I don't think anyone ever fixes anything that's broken there.  Or cleans anything. Stay away.
Inconsistent.  When it's good, it's phenomenal.  But when it's bad, it's down right awful. We've been ordering from Palone's since they first opened and it's been a roller coaster ride since day one.  The quality is all over the place from day to day.  One day it could be the best pepperoni pizza you've ever had and the next it could be worse than those square public school pizzas.  Also, I don't advise ordering within a half-hour or so of closing; it's been our experience on multiple occasions that they reheat an older pie rather than make a new one.
I cannot believe I haven't given a review of Pita Jungle yet! This is our lunch spot! And apparantly the rest of Phoenix considers it their lunch spot too....\n\nGood luck finding a parking spot ...\nHave fun waiting for a seat ...\n... because it is going to be busy!\n\nWe've started parking at the Walgreen's close by because it's ALWAYS packed. Annoying as it might be ... it just shows how AMAZING this place really is.\n\nThe hummus is sooo addictive. Seriously. I can't go a week without it! Their beef gyro puts Greek restaurants to shame. The cucumbers and tomatoes that come with the hummus are just scrumptious.\n\nNo matter what you're in the mood for - Pita Jungle will satisfy!
This place is a great local bar and food establishment.  Wonderful, easy, secure parking.  4-5 TV's in the bar area.  Separate restrauant so you can dine without the bar overlap.  Good beer selection.  Servers and hosts were cordial and efficient last night.  Appetizer was competent but nothing special (but then again, aren't most of them?).  \n\nBand in the bar area -- Bee'z is looking to expand their space into another adjacent room which would help immensely on giving both the audience and band some maneuver room.\n  \nRestroom was very tidy and clean.  Tables bused quickly.  Service was quick without being tackled at the door.  Self-seating when I came yesterday afternoon which is fine by me.\n\nIt takes only a few minutes past 79 376 to Bridgeville... would make a great local \"team\" viewing place.  \n\nSo many places to go to in the region and many are not well maintained.  Bee'z was so maintained.\n\nRoy
Great quality ingredients, great chicken kebab with fresh bread. If your into to hot sauces try theres! Only downside is wait time for chicken kebab was around 20 minutes.
Came in on a hot day to do some web design work and use their wifi. They have free wifi; just ask for the password. Immaculate interior, super sleek and clean. \n\nVery friendly staff. Everyone wanted to make sure I was happy, maybe because I was the only one in the shop. The iced salted caramel latte was VERY delicious but it was over $5 before tax. Not sure if extra work went into it but it tastes great compared to a regular iced caramel latte. Croissants are about $3 and are pretty good. Macarons are over $2 each. My favourite macaron was the salted caramel one. SO good. The prices seem on par with similar shops except for the iced latte which seemed a bit expensive, though it was better than most I've had. \n\nThe place is nice and quiet and I plan on coming here again on another work-from-home day.
Warm and inviting staff. Excellent fresh food, poke melted in your mouth and spiced just right. The miso soup is the best I have ever had, very flavorful. Clean and comfortable seating and reasonably priced. Can't go wrong.
Loved the kimchi side dishes with the entrees, especially the radish and the potatoes. The place feels modern and fun, with K-Pop on huge flat screens all around the dining area. The food is delicious, our server was adorable, and I wanted to stay after they closed just to keep watching the shows.
First time at Gangnam Street and loved it. The Kalbi was meaty and flavorful and the service was excellent as they checked on us often to ensure our satisfaction. The dishes of my wife and son were excellent as well (noodles with beef dish and chicken katsu). The Calamari appetizer too was really good and plentiful. Facility is clean and comfortable and we're looking forward to returning.
Great food and service. Cool place for a date night. Big screen tvs playing the game and K-Pop music. Ambiance is rustic and and cozy
Phenomenal short rib taco..\n$6.78 for one small, individual taco...?!\nDid they have a contest to see how much they could overcharge for a small piece of food?\nThe prices eliminate return visits.
Best hot dog I can ever remember having.  Had the devil dog and loved it!\nThe flavors went so well together.  Some sweetness from the onions and sriracha.  A little heat from the jalapenos and beer hot.  And some really good bread.  \n\nIt was a really good hot dog, but for 8 bucks it would be nice to get some chips with the dog.  SLD is so close to a 5 star review.  \n\nI would come back again and recommend to others.\n\nSo right next to Forge there is a small doorway that looks like you are going into Forge but your not.  Follow it to the end.  If you are coming from the southside the door looks like it is only for a juice bar but its not.  Go in and get a hot dog.  This place needs to do a better job and marking the doorways or something.
It is cheap, fast, and unhealthy ;) \n\nHowever, we all need a quick fix once  in a while and this place does it for me. \n\nIt was my first time on this location. In places like this, I do not have high expectations. Service was descent. \n\nUsually, you are in and out. For that reason I am giving them 4 stars.
I come here every week just to get my panang curry fix! Best I've ever had. Their lunch special is a great value.
Went for brunch. Pear mimosa was uniquely delicious. Was excited to see tofu scramble and hash browns on menu. But curry in a tofu scramble? Not tasty. If kitchen tried other spices. this could be a standout dish! Definitely needed more onions and green and red peppers (not hot).
I like Brats a lot for watching sports/hanging out with friends. The bartenders are pros and they make a pretty decent bloody mary (my general standard for bar quality). I wish the food was better though. Brats is not known for their food, so I didn't have high expectations, but even so I was pretty bummed about my dry, flavorless burger. My friends assure me, however that you can't go wrong with the chicken tenders, so I guess we'll see for next time.
Ah State Street Brats. I've had many a curd and cocktail at this bar. Each one more delicious than the last. Staff is friendly and efficient and the place (overall) is kept pretty clean considering how busy it gets. Don't expect gourmet eats and drinks at this place, but expect to have a great time with your buds, likely watching Badger sports. \n\nAs mentioned their food is standard 'Sconnie bar fare - burgers, brats, cheese curds, etc. Word to the wise - get the curds. In my humble opinion they serve up some of the best in the area. In terms of drinks, the menu is pretty vast and you can always score a cheap pitcher of Spotted Cow or a Rose Bowl if you're feeling adventurous. \n\nWith two levels, a great patio, plenty of seating and TV's (plus a wooden cow upstairs), Brats is prime for many great Badger games to come.
3.5 stars - bumping it up to 4 for generous portions...\n\nHubs grabbed takeout from Thai Orchid after a very long holiday weekend..I was itching for something spicy and noodle-y, thus pad thai seemed to fit the ticket. Price wise, our bill for two noodle dishes and an order of their fresh rolls came to $28. Not too shabby and a bit less than my Thai fave Uptown. Since I can't comment on the staff or the ambiance, I'll get right to the eats...\n\nFresh Rolls: Light, fresh and tasty spring rolls filled with chicken, carrots, cucumbers, and rice noodles, wrapped in rice paper and served with tangy peanut sauce. The menu said shrimp were in here too, but I didn't see any. Maybe it's an option? Nonetheless, they were large, fully stuffed and a perfect healthy start. \n\nPad Thai: Typical pad thai with shrimp, chicken, green onion and tons o' noodles. I asked for it spicy (not Thai spicy) and it had pleeeenty of kick. Blowing my nose kick. Kick start my metabolism. Flavor wise it's a nice pad thai - not my favorite in Charlotte, but well made and a generous portion. \n\nIf I'm in the SouthPark-ish area and jonesin' for some Thai, I'll definitely try Thai Orchid again!
Go on a Thursday night as they let you sit longer. Sit at the bar if you are two. Ask for Vince. Have the whipped fish for appetizer, Greek salad and the catch of the day. Prepared to be wowed. Great service, fantastic atmosphere.  \n\nI travel a lot. Great food and excellent service is hard to find. They nailed it.
Was in Toronto for business, and a colleague recommended I take a small group here. 6 of us sat at the chef table in the front window.  Server was friendly and knowledgeable about the food and wine. Personally, I was all about the tender sweetbreads for my starter and the grilled octopus for my main.  My dining guests were a bit less adventurous, opting for the chicken and the calamari.  We also loaded up on tzatziki, the eggplant spread, salad and spanakopita, oh and several bottles of a solid, blended Greek wine.  Overall, a nice evening in a great place in an up and coming trendy neighborhood.
Eggingtons is a place with good breakfast food and a weird dress code for the staff. All the Devore feels old world England and the waitresses are all wearing what seems to be safari kaki shorts with polos. Back to the food, wonderful omelets. I recommend the havarti and pear omelet. Great combination.
This is the best restaurant I have been to on Baldwin Street. The food is delicious, very French and really well flavored and sauced.\n Service is a little slow and -1 star. For the cost and the quality of food the service should not be amateur. For example, simply because one of our party had not yet arrived, that is no excuse to leave us unattended for the first 20 minutes without even water.\nThe food is really good though. The room is lovely, very cozy and homey. i would go back simply to try more of the selection. They had prix fixe for lunch but some of the choices were not available, so we all went with the regular menu. I had the escargot and sweetbread app, and a grilled swordfish entree. Others had french onion soup and loved it, duck and paella entrees. Universal praise for the food. Even the bread they served was excellent. Worth a visit.
This is a very reasonably priced family business with good orignal Mexican food. Good value for the price. Highly recommended it.
Nice little quiet lunch place.... And one of the better places I've eaten... A large Gyro and a large fry for under 6.00..  Good Service, smiling faces from the front girl, quick order up...\nI will revisit and tell my co-workers\nI'f your on the Charlotte West side near the airport check this place out.
